- The objective is to click the "Catalog" menu item in the left sidebar under the "SELL" section.
- The previous instructions attempted to click "Catalog" but failed, possibly because the menu item is a collapsible/expandable section rather than a direct link.
- In the current screenshot, the "Catalog" menu item is highlighted and appears to be expanded, as indicated by the downward arrow and the red border.
- However, no submenu items are visible, suggesting that the next step may be to click on a submenu item under "Catalog" (such as "Products", "Categories", etc.), or that the expansion did not fully trigger.
- To proceed, the best next step is to click on the "Catalog" menu item again to ensure it expands and reveals its submenu options.

- The previous attempts to select "Weight" in the "Attribute group" dropdown have failed, possibly due to timing or the dropdown not being properly expanded.
- The current screenshot shows the "Attribute group" dropdown is open, and "Weight" is visible as an option.
- The next logical step is to click on "Weight" in the dropdown to select it, which should enable the correct context for entering the value.
- Only after "Weight" is selected should we proceed to enter "500g" in the "Value" field.

- The objective is to click the "Catalog" menu item in the left sidebar under the "SELL" section.
- The previous instructions attempted to click "Catalog" but may not have succeeded, possibly because "Catalog" is a collapsible menu and not a direct link.
- In the current screenshot, the "Catalog" menu item is highlighted and expanded, but no submenu items are visible.
- To proceed, I should click on the first submenu item under "Catalog" to ensure navigation into the catalog section, as clicking "Catalog" itself may only expand/collapse the menu.

- Each row in the customer table likely has actions such as "Edit" or "Delete", but these are not currently visible in the screenshot.
- The "Delete" link is likely to be found as an action associated with each customer row, possibly appearing when hovering over a row or in a dropdown menu.
- The next step should be to interact with a customer row to reveal possible actions, such as "Delete".

- The previous step was to click the checkbox for "Accessories supplier", but the current view is showing details for "Fashion supplier".
- There is a "Suppliers" tab visible, but the list of suppliers (including "Accessories supplier") is not currently shown.
- To proceed, I need to locate and display the list of suppliers, which likely includes "Accessories supplier", so I can check its checkbox.
- The most logical next step is to scroll up, as the supplier list may be above the currently visible section.

- To proceed, I should return to the most recent context where a 'Save' button is likely to be present, such as the product creation or editing interface.

- The previous step has already typed 'bird' into the "Search name" input field.
- However, the filter has not yet been applied, as the product list still shows items not matching 'bird' (e.g., "Customizable mug", "Brown bear notebook").
- There is a "Search" button next to the input field, which likely needs to be clicked to apply the filter.
- The next step should be to click the "Search" button to filter the products by the name 'bird'.

- The objective is to click the activated (color-changed) "heart" icon on the product card.
- The previous steps involved toggling the wishlist state and returning to the main product listing page.
- In the current screenshot, the "heart" icons on the product cards are visible.
- The activated (color-changed) "heart" icon should look visually distinct from the inactive ones (likely filled or colored, while inactive ones are outlined or gray).
- The leftmost product card ("Hummingbird Printed T-Shirt") appears to have a filled/colored heart icon, indicating it is activated, while the others are not.
- The next step is to click on the activated (color-changed) heart icon on the "Hummingbird Printed T-Shirt" product card.

- The objective is to click the activated (color-changed) "heart" icon on the product card.
- The current screenshot shows the "My wishlists" modal open, which is blocking interaction with the product cards and their heart icons.
- Previous attempts have repeatedly resulted in the "My wishlists" modal appearing after clicking the heart icon, requiring it to be closed before further actions can be taken.
- To proceed, the modal must be closed first to allow interaction with the product card and its heart icon.
