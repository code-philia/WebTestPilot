- The screenshot shows the "Description" field with a formatting toolbar (Bold, Italic, Link, List) and a large white area below it, which is the rich text editing area.
- The rich text area may be implemented as an iframe, which sometimes requires a specific action to focus or interact with it.
- To ensure the click is registered inside the editable area, the instruction should specify to click inside the large white area directly below the formatting toolbar, within the "Description" section.
- If the area is indeed an iframe, the Navigation Engine should be able to handle the context switch and click inside the editable region.

- The "Books on this shelf" and "Add books to this shelf" sections are already visible, but they do not appear to be expandable/collapsible.
- It is possible that the "▸ Books" button is located elsewhere on the page, possibly above or below the currently visible area.
- Since the page was just scanned, and the "Books" section is not visible, the next step should be to scroll up to check if the "▸ Books" button is above the current view.

- The current screenshot shows the "Create New Shelf" form, with a section at the bottom left labeled "Cover image" that has a "▸" icon, and a section on the right with "Book1" and "Book2".
- The "▸ Books" button is not immediately visible in the current viewport, but the "Books" section is likely collapsed and represented by a similar "▸" icon as seen with "Cover image".
- Since the "Cover image" section is visible, the "Books" section may be just above or below, possibly out of the current viewport.
- The best next step is to scroll down to reveal more of the page and locate the "▸ Books" button.

- The objective may be misunderstood: if the intent is to select or interact with the "Rule" name field, it is already selected.
- If the intent is to interact with a rule in the sort operations, the only interactable elements are the configured and available operations.

- The current screenshot shows the "Sorting" settings page, but there is no visible confirmation dialog or "Confirm" button present.
- The sort rule is still present, indicating that deletion has not been initiated.
- Since the confirmation dialog is not visible, the prerequisite action (triggering the dialog) has not succeeded.
- The next step should be to ensure the confirmation dialog is triggered. The small blue square with the white trash bin icon to the right of the sort rule is likely the correct element to click, but previous attempts may have been too ambiguous or not precise enough.
- To proceed, I should instruct the Navigation Engine to click specifically on the small blue square with the white trash bin icon to the right of the sort rule, as this is the most likely way to trigger the confirmation dialog.

next_engine: Navigation Engine
instruction: Click on the small blue square with the white trash bin icon to the right of the sort rule "Name - Alphabetical (Asc), Created Date (Asc)" to trigger the confirmation dialog.

- The previous attempts to delete the sort rule by clicking the trash bin icon have failed, possibly because the confirmation dialog never appeared or the icon was not interactable.
- The current screenshot shows the "Sorting" settings page, but there is no visible confirmation dialog or "Confirm" button present.
- Since the confirmation dialog is not visible, it is not possible to click the "Confirm" button at this stage.
- The next logical step is to ensure that the confirmation dialog is triggered by interacting with the trash bin icon again, as this is the standard way to prompt such dialogs.
- If the dialog appears, the "Confirm" button can then be clicked in the following step.

- The objective is to verify that the rule "Name - Alphabetical (Asc), Created Date (Asc)" no longer appears in the listing.
- The previous attempts to delete the rule have failed, as indicated by the repeated [FAILED] steps.
- In the current screenshot, the rule "Name - Alphabetical (Asc), Created Date (Asc)" is still visible under "Sort Rules".
- This means the rule still appears in the listing, so the objective is not yet achieved.
