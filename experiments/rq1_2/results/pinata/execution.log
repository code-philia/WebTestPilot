</test_case>

Your focus is on the following step:
<current_step>
1. action: From the dashboard click "Books" link in navigation, assertion: Books listing page appears
</current_step>



Current URL: http://localhost:8081/
Page title: BookStack

You are at the top of the page. Viewport size: 1280 x 720, Viewport position: (0, 0), Page size: 1270 x 720

Plan for the current test step by following these instructions:

1. Analyze the test step carefully. Identify the action part and, if present, the assertion/expected result part.

2. Analyze the screenshot of the web application. Identify the various parts that will play a role in the conducting of the test step.

3. Consider the accomplished steps and browser command history to understand the context of the current step and learn from previous mistakes. Identify any information that may influence your planning.

4. Convert the test step into a sequence of Act and Assert statements. Each statement should be atomic and focused on a single action or assertion/observation. Use the following format:
   act("action description")
   assert("assertion description")
These should only consists of actions and assertions on the web application. Act workers can only do clicks / typing / gotos / scrolling. Assert workers only get a screenshot of the current state of the application and verify whether their query is true.
Make sure your act/assert planning is chronologically correct.

5. Determine whether your proposed sequence is "full" or "partial":
  - "Full": If the sequence, when completed, would fully satisfy the requirements of the test step.
  - "Partial": If you anticipate that the current available information does not allow for complete planning due to expected UI changes or page transitions.

Your goal is to create clear, actionable sequences that will guide the worker agents in executing the test step accurately and efficiently. You must do so while rigorously adhering to the following guidelines.

Planning Guidelines:
  - Be as specific and detailed as possible in your Act and Assert statements
  - Consider the context provided by the accomplished steps and browser command history
  - Only set the sequence to 'partial' if you really cannot plan ahead (especially act queries) given the information you currently have given the test step and the screenshot
  - Do not plan further than what the current step encompasses. Another orchestrator will take care of the next step, if any
  - Workers do not have much memory about previous steps. Be specific with the data to use or check
  - Worker's query should be in natural language and descriptive enough

Act Guidelines:
  - Actors should have active objectives implying clicks, fill, gotos, selects, etc. Simply etting focus or expanding a dropdown is not enough of a task for actors
  - Actors are smart and multi-turn, take that into consideration
  - It is useless to explicitely ask actors to click on elements to gain focus: do not do this, it can only make the whole execution crash
  - Sometimes actors are lazy and don't attempt scrolling the webpage. If it is the case, explicitely ask them to do so
  - Actors cannot hover yet: don't ask them to

Assert Guidelines:
  - Do not overly assert that things went well, focus on what the test case requires to verify
  - In case of failed assertions, only ask for assert confirmations if you clearly see the assertor might have been wrong

</test_case>

Your focus is on the following step:
<current_step>
1. action: From the dashboard click "Books" link in navigation, assertion: Books listing page appears
</current_step>



Current URL: http://localhost:8081/
Page title: BookStack

You are at the top of the page. Viewport size: 1280 x 720, Viewport position: (0, 0), Page size: 1270 x 720

Plan for the current test step by following these instructions:

1. Analyze the test step carefully. Identify the action part and, if present, the assertion/expected result part.

2. Analyze the screenshot of the web application. Identify the various parts that will play a role in the conducting of the test step.

3. Consider the accomplished steps and browser command history to understand the context of the current step and learn from previous mistakes. Identify any information that may influence your planning.

4. Convert the test step into a sequence of Act and Assert statements. Each statement should be atomic and focused on a single action or assertion/observation. Use the following format:
   act("action description")
   assert("assertion description")
These should only consists of actions and assertions on the web application. Act workers can only do clicks / typing / gotos / scrolling. Assert workers only get a screenshot of the current state of the application and verify whether their query is true.
Make sure your act/assert planning is chronologically correct.

5. Determine whether your proposed sequence is "full" or "partial":
  - "Full": If the sequence, when completed, would fully satisfy the requirements of the test step.
  - "Partial": If you anticipate that the current available information does not allow for complete planning due to expected UI changes or page transitions.

Your goal is to create clear, actionable sequences that will guide the worker agents in executing the test step accurately and efficiently. You must do so while rigorously adhering to the following guidelines.

Planning Guidelines:
  - Be as specific and detailed as possible in your Act and Assert statements
  - Consider the context provided by the accomplished steps and browser command history
  - Only set the sequence to 'partial' if you really cannot plan ahead (especially act queries) given the information you currently have given the test step and the screenshot
  - Do not plan further than what the current step encompasses. Another orchestrator will take care of the next step, if any
  - Workers do not have much memory about previous steps. Be specific with the data to use or check
  - Worker's query should be in natural language and descriptive enough

Act Guidelines:
  - Actors should have active objectives implying clicks, fill, gotos, selects, etc. Simply etting focus or expanding a dropdown is not enough of a task for actors
  - Actors are smart and multi-turn, take that into consideration
  - It is useless to explicitely ask actors to click on elements to gain focus: do not do this, it can only make the whole execution crash
  - Sometimes actors are lazy and don't attempt scrolling the webpage. If it is the case, explicitely ask them to do so

You are an Actor agent in a multi-agent system designed to perform manual test cases on web applications. Your role is to analyze the current state of the web application and determine the next action to take based on the given act query.

Here is a list of actions that have been performed on the web application for this run:


Your role is to focus on the task below:
<act_query>
Click on the 'Books' link in the top navigation bar.
</act_query>

Current URL: http://localhost:8081/
Page title: BookStack

You are at the top of the page. Viewport size: 1280 x 720, Viewport position: (0, 0), Page size: 1270 x 720

You receive a screenshot of the current state of the web application. Active elements have been manually overlayed by a colored semi-transparent box and given a numerical label, visible on screen.

Please follow these steps in order:

1. Current Webpage Identification:
   Think about what the current webpage is, based on the screenshot and previous actions.

2. Screenshot Details Analysis:
   Closely examine the screenshot to check the status of every part of the webpage. Understand what you can operate with and what has been set or completed. Pay special attention to the effects of previous actions that may not be clearly recorded in the textual history.

3. Act Query progress:
   Evaluate your progress toward completion of the act query, if any, and what remains to be done. Write N/A if it is your first round.

4. Next Action:
   Based on your analysis, the act query progress, and the work of previous agents, discuss on the best next action. Consider human web browsing habits and the logic of web design. Always justify how this action relate to the completion of the act query.

5. Element Recognition: 
   Determine if the element that the next action targets is in the screenshot or not. If it is, clearly outline its detailed location, and the corresponding label.

Here is the list of available commands for you to use as the next action:
- click: Click on an element given its label. Arg: label (int)
- goto: Navigate a browser to the specified URL. Arg: url (string)
- fill: Type text into an input element given its label. Args: label (int), value (string)
- select: Select the provided options in a select element given its label. Args: label (int), options (string)
- scroll: Scroll the page up or down. Arg: direction (up / down)
- finish: Signal that you have finished all your objectives. Args: status (success_fail), reason (string, optional)

If you believe you accomplished the task that were assigned to you, use the 'finish' command with a 'success' status.
If you cannot complete the task or if there's an issue, use the 'finish' command with a 'fail' status and provide a reason.

Remember:
  - If suggestions appear when typing in a text field, click on one of the suggestions to confirm the fill action
  - If the label you chose led to unexpected behavior, consider the possibility that you misread the label
  - If the element you want to interact with has not been labelled, return with the finish command and a failed status, and explicitely say there is a grounding issue
  - If you don't see the element you are asked to interact with, try scrolling down (or up, if it makes more sense), especially since your viewpoint is pretty small
  - Sometimes target elements are not exactly described as they really are (using a synonym for instance), make sure there is no doubt before scrolling down

Follow the process below:

<workers_analysis>
Carefully review the execution report to understand the outcome of the previous sequence execution. We have provided with a screenshot taken at the end of each worker's execution. What went wrong?
</workers_analysis>

<last_screenshot_analysis>
Look at the screenshot associated with the last worker of the sequence. Analyze its content to help you decide on what to do next.
</last_screenshot_analysis>

<recovery>
Since the previous sequence failed:
   a. Determine if it's possible to recover from the failure without deviating significantly from the test intent.
   b. If recovery is possible, explain how it is still aligned with the test case's overall logic and intent.
   c. If recovery is not possible or would require significant deviation from the test intent, decide to stop the test case execution and assign a failed verdict.
</recovery>

<decision>
State your decision: "try new plan" or "assign verdict"
</decision>

If you decided to continue with a new sequence (partial or full) to continue progressing towards the completion of the test step, follow the same format and guidelines as in the initial planning phase for creating Act and Assert statements.

Remember, your goal is to make the best decision for the test execution based on the available information and to provide clear, actionable guidance for the next steps or a well-justified conclusion to the test case.
Please do not diverge from the test step. Accomplishing it should be straightforward. If it not possible, probably best to assign a failed verdict a call it a day.
Labels are ephemeral, do not use them to guide your workers if you noticed they used the wrong label. Instead, give them precise spatial information.
