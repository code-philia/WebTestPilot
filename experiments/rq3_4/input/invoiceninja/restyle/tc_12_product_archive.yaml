Once the actions menu has been successfully opened, proceed to select the 'Archive' option from the list provided. For those seeking technical guidance, ensure that upon selection, an archive confirmation dialog box should appear on your screen. If you encounter any issues at this stage, double-check that you've clicked the correct button; otherwise, click 'Yes' or 'Confirm' within the confirmation dialog to proceed. Imagine a scenario where you're confirming the archiving of a cherished item; now, click the confirm button to finalize it. The system will then display a success alert message stating 'Successfully archived product,' which acts as a confirmation of the action taken. In simpler terms, this means the product has indeed been archived successfully. Next up, head over to the products listing section by navigating through the appropriate
  menus. Upon reaching the products listing page, take a moment to observe that it's correctly displayed before proceeding. Now, here’s a quick check for you: make sure the recently archived product no longer shows up in the active list, indicating it has been removed from the main listing. To access the archived products, simply switch to the archived products view, allowing you to see them separately from the active ones. Lastly, to wrap things up, verify that the product you just archived is now visible in the archived products view, confirming everything went as planned."
