description: "To begin, you should locate and click on either the \"More Actions\" or simply the \"Actions\" dropdown menu. Once the actions menu has been successfully opened, proceed to select the 'Archive' option from the list provided. Note: After clicking 'Archive', users will observe that the page updates to indicate the product's archived status. If you're wondering how to confirm the product is indeed archived, just check the page for any visual cues confirming the action was completed. Once upon a time, there was a user who clicked the magic button labeled 'Archive', and lo and behold, the product vanished into the digital archives! Finally, don't forget to ensure everything went smoothly by giving it a quick glance over."
