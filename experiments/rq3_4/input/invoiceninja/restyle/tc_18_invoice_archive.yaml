description: To begin, you'll want to interact with the interface by clicking on either the "More Actions" or simply the "Actions" dropdown menu. Once the actions menu has been successfully opened, proceed to select the "Archive" option from the list provided. For those seeking technical guidance, ensure that upon selection, an archive confirmation dialog box should appear on your screen. If you encounter any issues at this stage, double-check that you've clicked the correct "Yes" or "Confirm" button within the confirmation dialog to proceed. A narrative unfolds as the system acknowledges the action with a success alert, confirming that the invoice archiving process has been completed without a hitch. In a more casual tone, it's like the system gives you a thumbs up with the message "Successfully archived invoice" popping up for verification. Moving along, let's shift our focus to navigating through the system by heading over to the invoices listing section. Reference material 
  indicates that upon arrival, the invoices listing page should be clearly displayed before your eyes. To ensure everything is in order, take a moment to verify that the recently archived invoice no longer makes an appearance in the active list, effectively removing it from the main listing. Conceptually speaking, accessing the archived invoices view allows for a separate examination of these items, providing a clean division between active and archived records. Lastly, confirm that the invoice in question now resides in the archived list, making it visible within the archived invoices view for future reference.
