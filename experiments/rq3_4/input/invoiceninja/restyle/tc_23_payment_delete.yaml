description: To begin, you'll want to interact with the interface by clicking on either the "More Actions" or simply the "Actions" dropdown menu. Once the actions menu has been successfully opened, proceed to select the "Delete" option listed within it. For those seeking technical guidance, ensure that upon selection, a delete confirmation dialog box should materialize on your screen. Imagine encountering an issue where the confirmation dialog doesn't appear; the solution would be to check if the previous step was executed correctly and try again. With the confirmation dialog now visible, click the "Yes" or "Confirm" button to finalize the action. A narrative unfolds as the system acknowledges the command, displaying an alert message that reads "Successfully deleted payment," signifying the operation's success. In simpler terms, this alert is just the system's way of saying, 'Hey, we got rid of that payment for you!' Now, head over to the payments listing section as instructed. Upon 
  arrival at the payments listing page, take a moment to confirm its presence and functionality. Lastly, scrutinize the active list to ensure the recently deleted payment has indeed vanished, thus confirming its removal from the main listing.
