description: "To begin, one must navigate their cursor over to the \"Payments\" link nestled within the navigation menu and give it a click. Next up, you'll find yourself on the Payments listing page; it’s like entering a new chapter in your financial management story. For those looking for detailed instructions, simply locate and press the \"Enter Payment\" button to proceed. Technically speaking, once the button is activated, a payment creation form should materialize before your eyes. If you're having trouble, try clicking inside the client selection field to focus the dropdown or combobox. Now, here comes the fun part: either select or manually type \"company_name\" into the field to pick your client—it’s like choosing a character in a video game. With the client now selected for the payment, move on to the invoice selection field by clicking it. A list of client invoices will magically appear in the invoice dropdown, awaiting your choice. To ensure accuracy, carefully select an invoice
  bearing the number \"123456\" from the dropdown menu. Once invoice \"123456\" is chosen, it’s time to decide on the payment method. Click on the payment type selection field to reveal the available options. From there, opt for the \"Bank Transfer\" payment type by clicking it—this sets the stage for the transaction. After selecting the payment type, hit the \"Save\" button to finalize everything. The payment is now officially created and stored in the system. Lastly, to confirm success, check if the page displays the \"Edit Payment\" text, indicating that the payment entry is indeed complete."
