description: To begin the process, you should click on the "Payments" link located within the navigation menu. Next, you'll find yourself on the Payments listing page, where all your payment records are neatly displayed. Now, proceed to click the "New Payment" button, which will open up the Payment creation form for you. Once the form is open, focus on the client selection field by clicking inside it; this action ensures the client dropdown or combobox becomes active. If you're looking for a specific client, simply select or type "company_name123456" into the field, making sure the correct client is chosen for the payment. After selecting the client, move on to the invoice selection field and click there; the Invoice dropdown will then reveal all the client's invoices. From the list, pick an invoice with a "Sent" status, ensuring it gets linked to the payment correctly. At this point, double-check that the payment amount has been automatically filled in from the selected invoice, 
  confirming it matches the invoice total exactly. When ready, click inside the "Date" field to bring up the Date picker or focus the field, allowing you to select or input the payment date accordingly. With the date set, hit the "Save" button to finalize and store the new payment entry. Upon saving, keep an eye out for the success alert message "Successfully created payment" popping up, as it confirms everything went smoothly. Lastly, scroll down to the payments listing to verify that the newly created payment now appears in the table. As a final step, check if the linked invoice's status has updated appropriately, indicating that the related invoice might now show as payment received.
