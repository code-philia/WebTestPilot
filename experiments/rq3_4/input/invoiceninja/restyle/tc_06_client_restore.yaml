description: To begin, you should click on the "Clients" link found within the navigation menu. Once the Clients listing page appears, it's time to engage with the filter or view options to reveal those clients who have been marked as deleted. For technical reference, ensure that the deleted clients view is indeed accessible after applying the necessary filters. If you're having trouble locating the specific deleted client named "company_name Updated 123456", double-check your filter settings and try again. In a narrative twist, imagine finding the elusive deleted client, now visible thanks to your diligent filtering efforts. With the deleted client in sight, proceed to click the "Restore" button or action associated with it. It's important to note that the restore action must be available for you to continue. After clicking "Yes" or "Confirm" in the restoration dialog, the magic happens behind the scenes. An alert message reading "Successfully restored client" should appear, 
  confirming the operation's success like a victorious flag at the end of a race. To wrap up this journey, return to the active clients view where everything feels normal again. As a final check, verify that the standard clients listing is displayed without any hiccups. And there you have it; the restored client now appears in the active list, completing the circle and bringing the client back into the main fold.
