The expense edit form magically appears before your eyes, filled with the current values like a treasure chest ready to be updated. Next up, focus your cursor on the 'Amount' textbox, ensuring it's ready for action. Once the Amount field is focused, you'll notice it already contains the current amount, just waiting to be changed. Now, here’s the tricky part: clear out the existing amount and carefully type \"amount_updated123456\" into the field. Presto! The Amount field now displays the updated expense amount, reflecting your recent input. Don’t forget to click the 'Save' button to ensure all your hard work isn’t lost in cyberspace. After saving, keep an eye out for the alert message \"Successfully updated expense\"—it’s your confirmation that everything went according to plan. This success alert is more than just words; it’s proof that your expense has been updated
  successfully. To double-check, verify that the updated amount is now visible in the expense detail section, making sure no detail was left behind. Lastly, take a moment to scan the expenses table, where you should see the updated expense amount proudly displayed among its peers."
