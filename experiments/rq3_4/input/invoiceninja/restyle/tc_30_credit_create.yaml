Next up, follow these instructions carefully: once the Credits listing page materializes before your eyes, proceed to click the \"Enter Credit\" button. For those seeking a technical understanding, it's worth noting that upon clicking said button, a credit creation form will open, ready for your input. If you're puzzled about what comes next, don't worry—simply click inside the client selection field, and you'll find the client dropdown or combobox magically focused on your cursor. Once there, let your fingers dance across the keyboard as you type \"company_name\" into the field, and like magic, a list of clients will appear for your choosing. In a narrative twist, imagine yourself as a detective selecting the correct option from the lineup; choose \"company_name\" to ensure the right client is picked. With the client now in tow, direct your attention
  to the Credit Number field with a click, ensuring it's focused and ready for action. Now, fill \"123456\" into the Credit Number field, completing this crucial step in the process. Ready to add some spice? Click the \"Add Item\" button, and voila—a line item is added to your growing list. As you continue your adventure, click in the product selection field for the first line item, and watch as the product selection dropdown unfolds its secrets. Type \"product_name1\" into the field of the first line, and a list of product options will emerge, awaiting your decision. Select \"product_name1\" for the first line item, and the product will seamlessly integrate into your line item. Feeling ambitious? Click \"Add Item\" again to introduce a second line item into the mix. With the second line item row now present, type \"product_name2\" into the product selection field of the first line, and once more, a list of product options will appear for your perusal. Select \"product_name2\" for the first
  line item, and the product will be added to the line item with a flourish. Finally, click the \"Save\" button, and the credit will be created and saved, marking the end of this chapter. To verify your success, check that the page now contains the \"Edit Credit\" option, a clear sign that your credit has been successfully created."
