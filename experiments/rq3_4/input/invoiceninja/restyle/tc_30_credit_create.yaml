Next up, follow these instructions carefully: once the Credits listing page materializes before your eyes, proceed to click the \"New Credit\" button. For those seeking a technical understanding, it's important to note that upon clicking said button, a Credit creation form will open, ready for your input. Imagine a scenario where you're at a critical juncture; you must now click into the client selection field, as this step is crucial for moving forward. The client dropdown or combobox becomes the focal point, awaiting your interaction to focus on it. Now, let’s dive into the conceptual aspect: selecting or typing \"company_name123456\" is akin to choosing a character in a story, setting the stage for further actions. With the client now selected for the credit, you’re ready to embark on the next phase of this adventure. If
  you encounter any issues, remember that clicking \"Add Item\" or navigating to the line items section should reveal the Line items section available for your perusal. As the narrative unfolds, click into the product selection field for the first line item, and watch as the Product selection dropdown opens like a curtain revealing the next act. Selecting \"product_name123456\" for the first line item is like adding a key ingredient to a recipe, essential for the final dish. Once the product is added to the line item, take a moment to verify that the quantity and price fields are populated correctly, ensuring everything is in order. The line item now displays all the necessary product details, a testament to the meticulous process you’ve followed. To continue building your credit, click \"Add Item\" again, and voila! A second line item row magically appears, ready for your input. Select another product for this new line item, and just like that, the second product is seamlessly added to
  the credit. As you approach the climax of this task, click the \"Save\" button, and the credit will be created and saved, marking a significant milestone. Keep an eye out for the success alert message \"Successfully created credit\" appearing on screen, as it confirms the completion of your endeavor. Lastly, to ensure everything is in order, verify that the newly created credit is listed among the others in the credits table. With one final check, confirm that the credit status reads \"Draft\", indicating that you've set the right initial conditions for future modifications."
