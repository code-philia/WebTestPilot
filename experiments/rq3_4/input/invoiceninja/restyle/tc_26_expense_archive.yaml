Once the actions menu has been successfully opened, proceed to select the \"Archive\" option from the list provided. For those seeking technical guidance, ensure that upon selection, an archive confirmation dialog box should appear on your screen. If you encounter any issues at this stage, double-check that you've clicked the correct button; otherwise, click \"Yes\" or \"Confirm\" within the confirmation dialog to proceed. Imagine a scenario where, after confirming, a success alert magically pops up, stating \"Successfully archived expense.\" This success alert serves as a confirmation that the expense has indeed been archived correctly. Next, follow these instructions: navigate to the expenses listing page. Upon reaching the expenses listing page, it's crucial to verify that the recently archived expense no longer appears in the active list
  of expenses. In a casual tone, one might say, 'Boom! The expense is now gone from the main listing.' Now, for a separate view, access the archived expenses section. Conceptually, think of archived expenses as a distinct category where you can review them independently. Finally, to wrap things up, make sure the expense you just archived is now visible in the archived expenses view, confirming everything went as planned."
