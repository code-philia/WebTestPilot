description: To navigate through your financial records, start by clicking the "Expenses" link found within the navigation menu. Next up, you'll want to ensure that the Expenses listing page appears correctly, setting the stage for further actions. For those seeking a more technical approach, remember to click on the filter or view options to reveal archived expenses, a step crucial for accessing past records. Imagine stumbling upon a hidden treasure as you locate the archived expense marked with the unique identifier "amount_updated123456"; it's there, waiting to be discovered in the filtered view. If you're ever stuck, just know that the "Restore" button or action for the archived expense is your lifeline, always ready to bring old entries back to life. Once you've clicked "Yes" or "Confirm" in the restoration dialog, it's like casting a spell that confirms the expense restoration, turning the past into the present. Keep an eye out for the success alert message "Successfully restored
  expense" appearing on your screen, a beacon that confirms everything went according to plan. With the restored expense now part of the active list, return to the standard expenses listing, where all is as it should be. Finally, to wrap things up, verify that the expense you restored indeed appears in the active list, completing the circle and bringing the expense back into the main fold.
