description: To begin the process, you should click on the "Edit" button or link, which will trigger the opening of the Invoice edit form populated with the existing values. Note that once the form appears, your next step is to locate the first line item quantity field; it's crucial for making adjustments. The line item quantity field is indeed visible, confirming that you're ready to proceed with the modification. Now, change the quantity from its default setting to "2", ensuring the field reflects this new input accurately. Once the quantity field shows the updated value, you'll observe that the line total updates automatically, demonstrating the system's responsiveness. Line item total recalculates, meaning the numbers adjust based on the new quantity entered. To ensure everything is working correctly, verify that the invoice total updates accordingly, reflecting all changes made thus far. The invoice total amount recalculates, providing an accurate reflection of the invoice's 
  current status. After confirming the calculations, click the "Save" button to store these modifications. The system then saves the invoice changes, preserving the updated information for future reference. An alert message reading "Successfully updated invoice" should appear, signaling that the operation was successful. This success alert confirms the invoice update, giving you peace of mind about the changes. Finally, verify that the updated quantities and totals are displayed properly, ensuring that all modifications have been applied correctly. The invoice now shows the updated line item details, completing the task seamlessly.
