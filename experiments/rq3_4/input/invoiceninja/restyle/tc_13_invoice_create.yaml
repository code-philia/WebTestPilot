description: "To begin the process, one must click the \"Invoices\" link located within the navigation menu. Next, you'll find yourself on the Invoices listing page, where all your invoices are neatly organized. For creating a new invoice, proceed by clicking the \"New Invoice\" button, which will then reveal the invoice creation form before you. The client selection field awaits your interaction; simply click it to bring focus to the client dropdown or combobox. Now, here's the tricky part: you need to either select or type \"company_name123456\" into the field to pick the right client for your invoice. Once the client is selected for the invoice, move on to the next step by clicking \"Add Item\" or heading over to the line items section. Imagine you're in a store looking for products; similarly, click in the product selection field for the first line item to open the product selection dropdown. From there, it's like choosing a prize: select \"product_name123456\" for the first line item,
  and voila! the product is added to your line item. Before moving forward, ensure that the quantity and price fields are automatically filled with the correct values, as the line item should now display all the product details. To expand your invoice, click \"Add Item\" once more to introduce a second line item, thus adding another row to your invoice. With the second line item in place, select another product just as you did before, ensuring it gets added to the invoice seamlessly. Finally, when everything looks good, click the \"Save\" button to solidify your work. If all goes well, an alert message reading \"Successfully created invoice\" should pop up, confirming that your invoice has indeed been created. To double-check, verify that the newly created invoice now appears in the invoices listing, making sure it's not overlooked. Lastly, take a moment to confirm that the invoice status reads \"Draft,\" indicating that it's ready for any further edits or final touches."
