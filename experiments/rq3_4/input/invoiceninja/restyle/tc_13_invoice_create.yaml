description: "To begin your journey through the invoicing system, you'll want to click the \"Invoices\" link nestled within the navigation menu. Next up, you're greeted with the invoices listing page appearing before your eyes like a digital ledger. Now, follow these instructions carefully: locate and click the \"New Invoice\" button to proceed. An invoice creation form magically opens, ready for your input. Let’s focus on the client selection field; give it a click to bring it into focus. For those tech-savvy users out there, the client dropdown or combobox becomes the center of attention once focused. To choose your client, either select or type \"company_name\" into the designated space. Once the client is selected for the invoice, it’s time to confirm by choosing the \"company_name\" option from the list. If you encounter any issues, remember that clicking the invoice number field should resolve focus problems. With the invoice number field now focused, type \"123456\" to fill it up.
  Moving along, the invoice number field is filled, and we’re ready for the next step. A narrative unfolds as you click \"Add Item\" or find your way to the line items section, where magic happens. The line items section is available, awaiting your command. For the first line item, click in the product selection field to bring it into focus. As you fill \"product_name1\" into the product selection field, a world of options appears in the form of a dropdown. From this list, select the \"product_name1\" option, and voila! product_name1 is selected for your invoice. Repeat the process by clicking \"Add Item\" or heading back to the line items section. The line items section remains available, a constant in our invoicing saga. For the second line item, click the product selection field to focus it once more. Type \"product_name2\" into the field, and watch as the product dropdown items appear like magic. Select the \"product_name2\" option from the dropdown, and it too finds its place in the
  invoice. Finally, click the \"Save\" button to seal the deal. The invoice is created and saved, a testament to your efforts. To ensure everything went smoothly, verify that the page displays \"Edit Invoice\"—this confirms the invoice's creation."
