Once the actions menu is open, proceed by selecting the 'Mark Paid' option from the list provided. Note that upon clicking 'Mark Paid', a dialog box or form should appear, allowing you to confirm the action. Imagine a scenario where you must ensure that all relevant payment details are either automatically filled in or ready for manual entry; this step is crucial for accuracy. If you encounter any issues with the payment information fields not being accessible, double-check that they are indeed present and functional. The next step involves a simple verification process: check that the invoice status has updated to reflect 'Paid'. Lastly, for confirmation purposes, the invoice status indicator will display the word 'Paid', signifying the successful completion of the transaction."
