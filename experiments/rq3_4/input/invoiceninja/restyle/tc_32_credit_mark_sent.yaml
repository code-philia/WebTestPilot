description: To initiate the process, you should click on "More Actions" or the status change dropdown, which is a straightforward step in managing your tasks. Once the actions menu opens, proceed by selecting the "Mark Sent" option, ensuring you're on the right path for updating the status. For those seeking technical guidance, remember that clicking "Yes" or "Confirm" will trigger the confirmation dialog, solidifying your action. Imagine a scenario where you've just clicked "Yes," and suddenly, a success alert pops up, confirming the status change like a magical revelation in a story. If you encounter any issues, simply check for the alert message stating "Successfully marked credit as sent" to ensure everything went smoothly. The success alert acts as a beacon, confirming that the status change has been successfully applied, much like a conceptual understanding of confirmation mechanisms. To verify the change, the credit status should now reflect "Sent," a clear indication that the 
  operation was successful. In a more casual tone, you'll see the credit status indicator proudly displaying "Sent," making it obvious what's happened. Now, navigate to the credits listing, as if you're embarking on a journey through your financial records. Upon reaching the credits listing page, take a moment to appreciate the display of all your credits, neatly organized for your review. Lastly, apply the sent credits filter to verify that the credit indeed appears there, completing the cycle with a satisfying closure. The credit, now in sent status within the listing, stands as a testament to the steps you've followed.
