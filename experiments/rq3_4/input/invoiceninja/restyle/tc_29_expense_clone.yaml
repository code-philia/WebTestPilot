description: To begin, you'll want to interact with the interface by clicking on either the "More Actions" or simply the "Actions" dropdown menu. Once the actions menu has been successfully opened, proceed to select the "Clone" or "Duplicate" option from the list provided. For your reference, the clone action will now initiate, setting the stage for the next steps in the process. Imagine a scenario where you're verifying that the expense clone form magically appears, filled with all the copied data from the original entry. The clone form, acting like a mirror, displays the original expense data for your review. If any modifications are necessary, feel free to adjust the cloned expense details accordingly; it's like tailoring a suit to fit just right. Keep in mind that expense details have the flexibility to be adjusted, much like the settings on your favorite gadget. After making your adjustments, direct your attention to the "Save" button and click it to finalize the changes. With the
  cloned expense now created and safely stored away, an alert message should pop up, proudly declaring "Successfully created expense." This success alert serves as a confirmation, a digital handshake if you will, assuring you that the expense clone has indeed been created. Next up, ensure that the newly cloned expense makes its debut in the expenses listing, like a new character joining the cast of a play. Lastly, take a moment to verify that the original expense remains untouched and unchanged, standing as a testament to the precision of the cloning process.
