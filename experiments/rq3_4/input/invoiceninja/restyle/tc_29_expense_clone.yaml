Next, follow these instructions carefully: once the Actions menu opens, proceed to click the \"Clone\" option. For your reference, after selecting the clone option, the system will initiate the Clone action automatically. If you're wondering how to proceed next, simply click inside the \"Amount\" textbox to focus it for input. Once the Amount field is focused, enter the value \"23,2340\" as instructed. After typing the amount, you should see the field now contains the value \"23,2340\". Now, here's what happens next in our little story: click the \"Save\" button to finalize the process. The cloned expense is created and saved successfully, adding a new entry to your records. To ensure everything went smoothly, verify that the newly cloned expense appears in the expenses listing. And just like that, the new cloned expense magically becomes visible in the expenses table.
  If you encounter any issues, check that the expense has indeed been logged; the page should show the expense's status as Logged."
