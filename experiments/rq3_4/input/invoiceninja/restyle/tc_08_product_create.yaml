Next, follow these instructions carefully: after the Products listing page materializes, proceed to click the 'New Product' button, which will unveil the product creation form before your eyes. For those seeking technical guidance, it's important to note that clicking inside the 'Product' name textbox will ensure the field is focused, ready for input. Imagine a scenario where you're crafting a new product; you would then type \"product_name123456\" into the name field, ensuring its uniqueness like a snowflake in winter. If you encounter issues with the Description field not focusing when clicked, simply re-click to resolve the matter, allowing you to enter \"product_description123456\" seamlessly. The Price textbox, once clicked, becomes the center of attention, awaiting the entry of \"123456\" to denote a distinct price point. As
  we move along, entering \"1\" into the Default Quantity textbox focuses the field, setting a baseline stock level for our product adventure. In a similar vein, the Max Quantity textbox, upon being clicked, gains focus, enabling the input of \"10\" as the upper limit for quantity. With all fields filled, the final step involves clicking the 'Save' button, culminating in the creation and storage of the product. Upon successful execution, an alert message reading 'Successfully created product' should appear, serving as a beacon of confirmation. Lastly, to ensure everything has fallen into place, one must verify that the newly minted product graces the products listing, its presence undeniable within the table of items."
