description: To initiate the process, one should click on the "More Actions" or status change dropdown, as per the instructions provided. The actions menu opens up, revealing various options available for selection. For technical reference, ensure you select the "Mark Sent" option from the list presented. If you're wondering what happens next, a confirmation dialog will appear, asking if you wish to mark the item as sent. To troubleshoot any issues, simply click the "Yes" or "Confirm" button to proceed with the status change. Once upon a time, a user clicked "Yes," and lo and behold, the status change was confirmed without a hitch. An alert message, reading "Successfully marked invoice as sent," should pop up to confirm everything went smoothly. In a conceptual explanation, this success alert serves as a verification that the status change has been successfully applied. Now, to verify the invoice's new status, check if it changes to "Sent" as expected. The invoice status indicator will
  proudly display "Sent," indicating the task's completion. Navigate casually to the invoices listing page, where all your invoices are neatly organized. Upon arrival at the invoices listing page, you'll find it displayed just as you left it, ready for your review. Lastly, apply the sent invoices filter to verify that the invoice now appears among those that have been sent. And there you have it; the invoice is officially in sent status within the listing, completing our journey.
