description: To begin, you'll want to navigate your cursor over to the 'Expenses' link nestled within the navigation menu and give it a click. In technical terms, upon clicking the 'Expenses' link, the system transitions to display the Expenses listing page. Imagine yourself on an adventure where the next step is to press the 'New Expense' button, opening up a new world of expense creation. The Amount textbox is now awaiting your input; focus your attention here by clicking inside it. For those who might encounter issues, ensure the Amount field is indeed focused before proceeding with typing "123456" into it. Once the unique expense amount is entered, the magic happens automatically as the system recognizes the input. Now, let's switch gears and tackle the client selection field by clicking inside it, bringing forth the dropdown or combobox for your selection pleasure. With the client dropdown focused, simply select or type "company_name123456" to bind the chosen client to your 
  expense record. Moving along, direct your gaze towards the 'Date' field and click it to bring up the date picker or field for your interaction. After selecting or entering the expense date, the system locks it in place, setting the stage for further details. If the option presents itself, feel free to add a description or category to enrich the expense details. With all fields filled out, the final act involves clicking the 'Save' button, sealing the deal on your expense creation. Keep an eye out for the success alert message "Successfully created expense" popping up to confirm everything went according to plan. Lastly, to ensure accuracy, cross-check that the newly minted expense is indeed listed among the other entries in the expenses table.
