description: "To begin, you'll want to navigate your cursor over to the 'Expenses' link nestled within the navigation menu and give it a click. Once you've done that, behold! The Expenses listing page magically materializes before your eyes. Next up, follow these instructions carefully: locate the 'Enter Expense' button and press it with your mouse. For those who are technically inclined, understand that upon clicking the Client field, the system focuses on said field, readying it for input. If you're ever stuck, just remember: when you type \"company_name\" into the client field, a dropdown will appear, offering you various client options to select from. In a narrative twist, imagine selecting the option \"company_name\" from the list, thus assigning it as the chosen client for your expense entry. Now, let's shift gears and focus on the \"Amount\" textbox; simply click inside it to bring it into focus. An important note here: after typing \"2,3234\" into the amount field, the system automatically
  rounds it to \"2,324\". Moving along, you'll find that clicking the \"Currency\" field triggers a dropdown menu, presenting you with an array of currency options. Selecting \"Australian Dollar (AUD)\" from this list ensures your expense is recorded in the correct monetary unit. Finally, hit the \"Save\" button to immortalize your expense entry in the system's database. To verify everything went smoothly, check if the phrase 'Edit Expense' graces the page, confirming your successful creation. In essence, spotting the 'Edit Expense' text on the page is your golden ticket, proving beyond doubt that your expense has been created."
