description: "To begin, you should click on the 'Edit' button or link, which will trigger the opening of the client edit form populated with existing data. The next step involves focusing your attention on the 'Name' textbox, where you'll find the cursor already placed, ready for input. For those seeking technical guidance, ensure the Name field is highlighted and contains the current name before proceeding to clear it. Imagine now, you're tasked with updating the company's identity; simply type \"company_name Updated\" into the cleared field. Once the new name is entered, the Name field will refresh to display the updated company name, confirming your action. Now, follow these instructions carefully: locate and click the 'Save' button to commit the changes made to the client's profile. A quick verification process follows, where you must confirm that the updated name is accurately reflected in the client detail section. As the story unfolds, the client page magically transforms, showcasing
  the new name prominently in its header. Lastly, for those troubleshooting any discrepancies, double-check that the updated information is mirrored in the clients listing. And there you have it, the clients table now proudly displays the refreshed client name."
