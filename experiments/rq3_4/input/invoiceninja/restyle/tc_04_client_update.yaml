description: To begin, you should click on the 'Edit' button or link, which will open up the client edit form populated with the existing data. The next step involves focusing your attention on the 'Name' textbox, where you'll find the current name already entered for your convenience. For those seeking technical guidance, ensure the name field is highlighted and contains the existing company name before proceeding. Now, imagine clearing out the old name and typing "company_name Updated 123456"—this action updates the company's identity in the system. After entering the new name, the field should refresh to display "company_name Updated 123456," confirming the change visually. Next, hit the 'Save' button to commit these alterations to the database. If everything goes smoothly, an alert message reading "Successfully updated client" should pop up, indicating the process was a success. To double-check the update, look for the confirmation message that pops up, ensuring it matches what you
  expect. Finally, navigate back to the client detail section and observe if the updated name is correctly displayed in the header, completing the verification process. In the end, the clients table should reflect the updated client name, making sure all listings are accurate and up-to-date.
