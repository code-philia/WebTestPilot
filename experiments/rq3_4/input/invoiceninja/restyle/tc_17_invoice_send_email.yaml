description: To proceed with the task, you should click on the "Email Invoice" button or option available on your screen. Note that once this action is performed, an Email dialog will open, indicating the next step in the process. Now, carefully locate and click the "Send Email" button to initiate the transmission of the email. If you encounter any issues during this phase, ensure that all fields are correctly filled and try clicking the button again. After successfully sending the email, a magical journey begins as you click the "123456" invoice link, transporting you back to the invoice details page. Upon arrival at the invoice details page, it's like entering a new world where you must verify that the invoice status has indeed changed to "Sent". For reference purposes, remember that the invoice status updates automatically after the email is sent, confirming the completion of this critical operation.
