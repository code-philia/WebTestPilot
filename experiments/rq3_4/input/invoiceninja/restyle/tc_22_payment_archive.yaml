description: To begin, you'll want to interact with the interface by clicking on either the "More Actions" or simply the "Actions" dropdown menu. Once the actions menu has been successfully opened, proceed to select the 'Archive' option from the list provided. For those seeking technical guidance, it's important to note that upon selecting 'Archive', an archive confirmation dialog will appear on your screen. If you encounter any issues at this stage, ensure you click the 'Yes' or 'Confirm' button within the confirmation dialog to resolve the matter. Once the payment archiving process is confirmed, a narrative unfolds where a success alert message pops up, stating 'Successfully archived payment'. This success alert serves as a conceptual confirmation that the payment archiving was executed correctly. Now, casually speaking, head over to the payments listing for further verification. Upon navigating to the payments listing, you should observe that the page is indeed displayed before you.
  With a keen eye, verify that the archived payment no longer appears in the active list, indicating its removal from the main listing. To access the archived payments view, follow the straightforward path laid out for you. Finally, rest assured that the payment is now visible in the archived payments view, as you can separately verify its presence in the archived list.
