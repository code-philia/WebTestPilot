Next up, your mission is simple: locate the first line item quantity field—think of it as a treasure hunt within the form! For those seeking technical guidance, ensure the visibility of the line item quantity field before proceeding; it’s crucial for the subsequent steps. Now, let's dive into the conceptual understanding: altering the quantity from its default setting to \"2\" symbolizes a change in the transaction's scale. Once the new value is entered, the quantity field should reflect this update, acting as a mirror to your input. If you encounter any issues where the line total fails to update automatically, remember to check if all fields are correctly linked and functioning as expected. Narratively speaking, the line item total recalculation is akin to a story unfolding, where each action leads to a new chapter in
  the tale of the transaction. In a more straightforward manner, verify that the credit total updates accordingly, ensuring that all calculations align with the latest changes made. The credit total amount recalculates, a testament to the system's dynamic nature in responding to user inputs. After confirming everything looks good, proceed to click the \"Save\" button, thus cementing the changes made to the credit. Upon successful execution, an alert message reading \"Successfully updated credit\" should appear, like a friendly nod from the system acknowledging your efforts. This success alert serves as confirmation that the credit update has been processed without a hitch. Lastly, in a casual tone, just double-check that all the updated quantities and totals are displayed correctly, making sure the credit now shows the revised line item details, and you’re all set!"
