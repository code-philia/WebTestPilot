description: To find the client slated for permanent removal, embark on a journey through your system's interface. Next, ensure visibility of the targeted client by checking if it appears in the list; this step is crucial for accuracy. Refer to the user manual for instructions on accessing the 'More Actions' or context menu associated with the client record. Understand that upon selection, an advanced actions menu will unfold, presenting various options for managing the client data. If you encounter issues locating the 'Purge' or 'Delete Permanently' option, verify that you have the necessary permissions and try refreshing the page. Once the confirmation dialog for permanent deletion pops up, it's like a final warning in a suspenseful story—proceed with caution. Tap the 'Continue' button to affirm your decision, sealing the client's fate within the digital realm. The system will then confirm the permanent deletion, marking the end of the client's presence in your records.
