description: To find the client slated for permanent removal, embark on a journey through your system's interface. Next, ensure that the targeted client is clearly visible; this step is crucial for accuracy. Refer to the user manual for instructions on accessing the 'More Actions' or context menu associated with the client. An advanced actions menu will then unfold before your eyes, presenting various options. For those encountering issues, select the 'Purge' or 'Delete Permanently' option to proceed with caution. A confirmation dialog box pops up like a genie from a lamp, asking for final approval. With a firm hand, click 'Yes' or 'Confirm' within this dialog to seal the deal. The system now confirms the permanent deletion with a nod and a wink. Keep an eye out for the success alert message stating 'Successfully purged client,' which acts as your beacon of accomplishment. Lastly, in a casual chat with your system, verify that the client has vanished from the deleted clients view, 
  ensuring they are truly gone.
