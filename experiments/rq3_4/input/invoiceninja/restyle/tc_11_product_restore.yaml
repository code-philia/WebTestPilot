description: "To begin your journey through the product management interface, you should click the \"Products\" link found within the navigation menu. Next, follow these instructions carefully: once on the Products listing page, proceed to click on the filter or view options to reveal the deleted products. For those seeking technical details, it's worth noting that the deleted products view becomes accessible after applying the correct filters. If you're having trouble locating a specific item, consider this scenario: imagine you're searching for the deleted product named \"product_name Updated 123456\"; it should appear in the filtered view if everything is set up correctly. Now, for the next step, simply click the \"Restore\" button associated with the deleted product you've identified. Keep in mind that the restore action is indeed available for your convenience. When the restoration dialog pops up, make sure to click \"Yes\" or \"Confirm\" to finalize the process. An alert message reading
  \"Successfully restored product\" should pop up to confirm the operation was successful. To ensure everything went as planned, check for the success alert which confirms the product restoration. Once satisfied, navigate back to the active products view where the standard products listing will be displayed. Lastly, in a casual tone, just double-check that the restored product now appears in the active list, meaning it's back in the main lineup."
