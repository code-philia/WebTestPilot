description: "To begin, you should locate and click on either the \"More Actions\" or \"Actions\" dropdown menu, depending on what's available on your screen. Once the actions menu has been successfully opened, proceed to select the \"Delete\" option listed within it. For those encountering issues, ensure that after clicking delete, a confirmation dialog box pops up asking for final approval. Imagine a scenario where you're tidying up your digital inventory; you'd then click the \"Yes\" or \"Confirm\" button to finalize the product's removal. The system acknowledges the action with an alert stating \"Successfully deleted product,\" which is your cue that everything went as planned. In technical terms, the success alert serves as a verification mechanism confirming the execution of the product deletion command. Now, follow these steps: head over to the products listing section to continue the process. Upon reaching the products listing page, take a moment to observe that it has indeed loaded
  correctly. A quick check will reveal that the recently deleted item no longer graces the active product list, affirming its removal. Lastly, the product's absence from the main listing acts as a silent testament to the successful completion of the task."
