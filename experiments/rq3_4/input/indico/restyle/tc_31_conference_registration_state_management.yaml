description: To begin, you should locate and click the "Registration" link found within the navigation bar. Once clicked, the system will automatically display the Registration section for your convenience. For technical reference, ensure that after the section opens, you proceed to interact with the "Start now" button. If you're wondering how to initiate the registration process, simply clicking the "Start now" button will do the trick. Should you encounter any issues, clicking the "Close now" link will help you close the registration section effectively. In a narrative twist, imagine you've just closed the registration; now, to reopen it, you must click the "Reopen now" button. A confirmation dialog will pop up, asking if you're sure about reopening the registration. To finalize this step casually, just hit the "OK" button on the dialog box, and voila! The registration reopening is officially confirmed.
