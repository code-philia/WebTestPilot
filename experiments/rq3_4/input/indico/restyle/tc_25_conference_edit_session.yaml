Next up, the Sessions section magically unfolds before your eyes, revealing its contents. For those seeking precise instructions, simply locate and click the \"Add new session\" button to proceed. Understand that upon doing so, a session creation form will appear, ready for your input. Now, let's dive into the narrative where you place your cursor in the \"Title\" textbox, and suddenly, it becomes the center of attention, focused for your typing pleasure. In technical terms, the Title field is now active and awaiting your input; go ahead and type \"Session title\" into it. With the title field now containing a unique session title, move on to the next step without delay. As the story continues, focus shifts to the \"Description\" textbox, which you should click to bring into focus. An important note here: once focused, the Description field is primed
  for you to type \"Session description\" into it. After ensuring the Description field contains the appropriate text, the next logical step is to click the \"Save\" button. At this juncture, the session is officially created and stored away safely. Let’s rewind a bit and click the \"Sessions\" link again in the navigation bar. Once more, the Sessions section opens its doors, displaying all the sessions neatly. If you're looking to make adjustments, click the gear icon beside the first session listed. This action triggers the opening of the Session edit form, your gateway to modifications. Place your cursor in the \"Title\" textbox once more, and you’ll see the current title already there, waiting for updates. To update, clear the existing text and type \"Session title updated\" in the title field, transforming the content instantly. The Title field now proudly displays the updated session title, reflecting your recent changes. Don’t forget to click the \"Save\" button to ensure all session
  modifications are securely stored. Lastly, to confirm everything went smoothly, verify that the updated session title is correctly reflected in the sessions table. And there you have it; the Sessions list now accurately shows the updated title, completing our journey."
