description: To begin, you should click the "Clone" button, initiating the duplication process. Next, ensure that the Clone event dialog appears on your screen; it's crucial for proceeding. Now, carefully locate and click the close button within the "Clone Event" dialog box, as instructed in the manual. The clone operation is now underway, marking the start of the duplication sequence. Imagine a scenario where you must verify that the newly cloned lecture page is indeed displayed before you proceed further. A new lecture page opens up, presenting itself for your review. Confirm that the lecture name reads "Lecture," as expected in this setup. It's worth noting that the cloned lecture retains the same name, maintaining consistency. In case you encounter issues, check if the venue and room information remains intact post-cloning. Lastly, the location details are faithfully copied over to the clone, ensuring no data loss.
