description: "To begin, you'll want to focus on the action menu button, which is represented by three dots; it's your gateway to various options. Next, follow these steps carefully: after clicking the button, ensure the action menu dropdown has fully opened before proceeding. For reference, the 'Change type' option is located within this dropdown, and selecting it will reveal a submenu with additional choices. Understand that when you click 'Lock,' a confirmation dialog will appear, prompting you for final approval. Once upon a time, a user faced a critical decision: they had to confirm the lock by clicking 'Lock event,' and thus the lecture was secured. If you encounter issues at this stage, remember that the lock confirmation dialog is your friend, guiding you through the process. Now, let’s return to the action menu button, where our journey began, and click it once more. The action menu dropdown reappears like an old friend, ready to assist with further actions. Lastly, in a casual tone,
  just tap on 'Unlock' and watch as the system triggers the unlock action seamlessly."
