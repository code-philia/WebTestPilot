description: "To begin the process, you should click on the \"Registration\" link found within the navigation bar. Next, follow these instructions carefully: proceed to click the \"Create form\" link. For your reference, once you do this, a dialog box titled 'Registration form creation' will appear on your screen. Imagine a story where a user clicks inside the \"Title\" textbox, and suddenly, it becomes ready for text entry. If you're having trouble focusing the title field, ensure no other elements are selected before clicking inside it. Simply type \"Registration Form\" into the title field, as if you were naming a new chapter in a book. The title field now holds the name of your form, acting as its identifier. To finalize everything, hit the \"Create\" button with confidence. Congratulations! Your registration form has been successfully created, ready for use."
