For your reference, ensure that the 'Delete' option is clearly visible within this dropdown list. Understanding why the delete option is present here involves recognizing its role in managing events. If you encounter any issues with the visibility of the 'Delete' option, double-check that the menu has fully loaded. Once you've located it, proceed by clicking on the 'Delete' option, which triggers the next step. A confirmation dialog pops up unexpectedly, asking if you're sure about deleting the event. Make sure to check the box labeled 'I understand what this means,' confirming your awareness of the consequences. With the confirmation checkbox now checked, you're ready to finalize the action. Press the 'Delete event' button to confirm your decision and remove the conference from the schedule. 
  Afterward, an alert message should appear, stating 'Event successfully deleted,' which is the expected outcome. The success alert serves as a confirmation that the conference has indeed been deleted from your calendar.
