description: "To begin the process, you should click the \"Registration\" link found within the navigation menu. Next, follow these instructions carefully: Click the \"Start now\" button to initiate the registration opening sequence. For technical reference, the system will display an alert message stating \"Registrations are now open\" upon successful initiation. If you're wondering how to confirm this step, simply look for a success alert that verifies the registrations have indeed been opened. Once everything is set, a narrative unfolds where you click the \"Close now\" link to start the closing procedure. Should you encounter any issues, check for the alert message \"Registrations are now closed\" to ensure the process was completed correctly. Moving forward, a casual reminder: Click the \"Reopen now\" button when you're ready to reopen registrations. Be prepared for a confirmation dialog box to pop up; just hit the \"OK\" button to proceed. Lastly, conceptual understanding is key here:
  The system will once again show the alert message \"Registrations are now open\" to confirm that the reopening has taken effect."
