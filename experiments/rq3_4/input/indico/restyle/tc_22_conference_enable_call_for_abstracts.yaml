description: "To begin, you'll want to interact with the workflows collapsible menu where the 'Call for Abstracts' option resides. Next, simply expand the workflows menu by clicking it, ensuring all options are visible. For technical reference, the 'Call for Abstracts' link should be clicked next, leading to the opening of its dedicated section. Imagine a scenario where you're exploring features; you'd then click the 'Enable module' button to activate the functionality. If you encounter any issues, remember that verifying the message 'The call for abstracts is not open yet' confirms the initial status has been correctly displayed. The narrative continues as you press the 'Start now' button, effectively opening the call for abstracts process. In a step-by-step guide, after starting, you would proceed to click the 'Close now' button, which logically closes the call for abstracts. A casual reminder: when you decide to 'Reopen now', a confirmation dialog will pop up, asking for your final decision.
  Lastly, to cancel the reopening action, just tap the close button located in the 'Confirm action' dialog header, and voila, the call for abstracts reopens as intended."
