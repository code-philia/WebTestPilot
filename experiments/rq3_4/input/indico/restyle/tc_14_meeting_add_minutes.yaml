Next, refer to the user interface guide where it states that clicking the action menu button, represented by a three dots icon, will open the action menu dropdown. Once the dropdown appears, follow these instructions: select the \"Add minutes\" option from the list. Suddenly, the minutes editor springs to life, opening up before your eyes. Now, focus on the Rich Text Area iframe by clicking inside it; this ensures the rich text editor becomes active and ready for input. With the editor focused, type \"Meeting Minute\" into the space provided, entering the text seamlessly into the editor's field. After typing, confirm that the text has indeed been entered by observing the editor's content update. To proceed, click the \"Save\" button, ensuring that all the minutes are securely stored within the system. Next, verify that the minutes content is accurately displayed
  in the editor by checking if the text matches what was entered earlier. In case you notice any issues with saving, ensure the \"Save\" button is disabled, indicating there are no unsaved changes left. Finally, close out the process by clicking the \"Close\" button, which will shut down the minutes editor, completing the task."
