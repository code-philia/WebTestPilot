description: "To begin your journey through the system, you'll want to click on the \"Timetable\" link found within the navigation bar. Next, follow these instructions carefully: once the Timetable view has opened up, locate and click the \"Add new\" dropdown button. For those seeking a technical reference, it's important to note that selecting the \"Add new\" option will reveal the Add new menu. Let me explain how this works conceptually: after the menu appears, you should choose the \"Contribution\" option from the list. If you're having trouble finding the right spot, just remember that clicking on the \"Title\" textbox will focus the Title field for your input. Once upon a time, there was a user who typed \"Session Contribution123456\" into the title field, making sure the name was unique. In simpler terms, after typing the title, you'll need to click the \"Save\" button to finalize everything. To ensure everything went smoothly, check that the newly created contribution now appears
  in the timetable canvas, complete with its number prefix. Lastly, just casually mentioning, the timetable should now display the numbered contribution for all to see."
