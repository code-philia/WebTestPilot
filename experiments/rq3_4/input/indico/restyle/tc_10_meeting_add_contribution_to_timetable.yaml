description: To begin your journey through the system, you'll want to click on the "Timetable" link found within the navigation bar. Next up, you're instructed to observe the opening of the Timetable view, confirming its successful display. For those seeking detailed guidance, refer to the "Add new" dropdown button and give it a click to reveal the Add new menu. Understanding the concept behind adding content, one must then select the "Contribution" option from the newly appeared list. Once the Contribution creation form magically appears before your eyes, proceed to interact with the "Title" textbox by clicking inside it. The Title field, now focused, awaits your input like an eager student ready for knowledge. With a casual flair, type "Meeting Contribution" into the title field, ensuring it stands out as a unique contribution name. Moving along, focus shifts to the "Description" textbox where you should click to bring it into focus. Now, let's troubleshoot any issues by typing 
  "Description" into the description field, making sure it contains the necessary text. When the time comes to set the schedule, click in the time field marked "--:--" to open the time picker. From there, select "11" from the time picker options, setting the start time precisely to 11:00. To add yourself as the author, simply click the "Add myself" button, and voila! The current user is now listed as the author. Finally, hit the "Save" button to ensure the Contribution is created and safely stored away. To verify everything went according to plan, check if the contribution named "Meeting Contribution" has indeed appeared in the timetable canvas. And there you have it, the timetable now proudly displays the new contribution for all to see.
