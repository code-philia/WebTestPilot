description: To begin, you should click the "Clone" button, initiating the duplication process. Next, observe as the Clone event dialog appears, ready for your interaction. For technical guidance, locate and click the close button situated within the "Clone Event" dialog header. The clone operation is now underway, as if a new entity is being birthed from the original. Ensure that the newly cloned conference page is indeed displayed before proceeding further. A new conference page opens, like a fresh chapter in a book of events. Confirm that the conference name remains unchanged in the cloned event, maintaining its identity. The cloned conference retains the exact same name as its predecessor, preserving legacy. Lastly, check that the venue and room information is accurately preserved, ensuring continuity. Rest assured, all location details are meticulously copied over to the clone, leaving no room for error.
