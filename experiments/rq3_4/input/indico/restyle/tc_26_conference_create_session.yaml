description: "To begin your journey into session management, you'll want to start by clicking the \"Sessions\" link found within the navigation bar. Next up, follow these instructions carefully: once the Sessions section has opened, locate and click the \"Add new session\" button. For those seeking a technical reference, it's worth noting that upon clicking said button, the system will present you with a session creation form. Imagine now, the cursor hovers over the \"Title\" textbox; a gentle click focuses the field, ready for your input. If you're wondering how to proceed, simply type \"Session title123456\" into the title field, ensuring its uniqueness among other entries. Moving along, let’s say you then click inside the \"Description\" textbox, which magically becomes the center of attention, focused and awaiting your next move. In a straightforward manner, enter \"Session description123456\" into the description field, filling it with the necessary text. With everything set, give the
  \"Save\" button a firm click, and voilà! The session is now created and safely stored away. To troubleshoot any doubts about the session's existence, take a moment to verify that it indeed appears in the sessions table. And there you have it, the narrative concludes with the sessions list proudly displaying the newly added session."
