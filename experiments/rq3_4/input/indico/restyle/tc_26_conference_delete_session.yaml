description: To begin, you should click on the "Sessions" link found within the navigation bar. Note that once this action is performed, the Sessions section will open up, revealing its contents. If you're looking to verify the initial state, ensure that the message stating "There are no sessions yet" is visible; this confirms the system's default setup. An empty sessions message being displayed indicates that no sessions have been added previously. Next, proceed by clicking the "Add new session" button, which triggers the appearance of the session creation form. Imagine a scenario where you type "Session title" into the designated title field; this step is crucial for naming your session. Once the title field contains the session title, it's time to focus on providing more details. Now, fill in the description field with "Session description" to give context to your session. With the description field now containing the appropriate text, you're ready to finalize this entry. After 
  clicking the "Save" button, the session is officially created and stored within the system. Should you wish to remove a session, simply click the trash icon next to the first session listed. A delete confirmation dialog will pop up, asking for your final approval. By clicking the "OK" button, you confirm the deletion of the session, effectively removing it from the list. To conclude, make sure that the message "There are no sessions yet" reappears, signifying that the sessions list has returned to its initial empty state.
