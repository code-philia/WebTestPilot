description: To begin, locate and tap the action menu button, which is represented by three dots. The action menu dropdown will then appear, revealing various options for you to choose from. For your reference, ensure that the 'Delete' option is clearly visible within this dropdown list. If you're wondering why this step is crucial, it's because the presence of the 'Delete' option confirms that the menu is functioning correctly. Should you encounter any issues where the 'Delete' option doesn't show up, double-check if the menu has fully loaded or try refreshing the page. Once you've confirmed its visibility, proceed by clicking on the 'Delete' option, which triggers the next phase of the process. A delete confirmation dialog pops up out of nowhere, like a surprise visit from an old friend, asking if you're really sure about this decision. Inside this dialog, there's a checkbox labeled 'I understand what this means,' which you need to check off to prove you're not acting on impulse. 
  With the confirmation checkbox now marked, all that's left is to click the 'Delete event' button, sealing the fate of the conference. Finally, the system acknowledges the conference deletion, bringing this operation to a close.
