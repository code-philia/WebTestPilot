description: To begin the process, you should click the "Create event" link found within the navigation bar. Next, ensure that the create event dropdown menu appears as expected. For those seeking detailed instructions, simply click the "Meeting" option from the dropdown list. The meeting creation form will open up, inviting you to proceed. Once the form is open, focus your attention on the "Event title" textbox and click inside it. Now, the event title field is ready for your input, awaiting the unique identifier you wish to assign. Let’s say you type "Meeting123456" into the title field; this action ensures the title field contains the unique meeting name. Moving forward, direct your cursor to the end date field, which is conveniently labeled "DD/MM/YYYY", and click there. With the date picker now focused, enter tomorrow’s date using the DD/MM/YYYY format to set the appropriate end date. After entering the date, you’ll notice the end date field accurately reflects tomorrow’s date. 
  When it comes to setting the end time, click in the field marked "--:--" to bring up the time picker. From the options presented, select "12" to finalize the end time at 12:00. To specify the venue, click in the "Venue" textbox, making it ready for your input. Type "Venue123456" into the venue field, ensuring it contains a unique name for the location. Similarly, click in the "Room" textbox to focus it, then type "Room123456" to fill in the unique room name. If you encounter any issues, remember that selecting the "Public" option for event protection mode will make the meeting accessible to everyone. Finally, click the "Create event" button to save all the details you’ve entered. A confirmation that the meeting has been successfully created is the appearance of its name in the page heading. As the meeting page loads, you should see the correct name prominently displayed in the heading. In the end, verifying that both the venue and room information are correctly displayed confirms 
  that the location details are properly shown on the meeting page.
