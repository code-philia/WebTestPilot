description: To begin, you'll want to navigate your cursor over to the "Create event" link nestled within the navigation bar. Once you've clicked it, a dropdown menu will appear, presenting various options for event types. Next, proceed to select the "Meeting" option from the list provided. Suddenly, a new window pops up, revealing the meeting creation form waiting for your input. Now, focus your attention on the "Event title" textbox; it's time to give this meeting a name. With the title field now active, type in "Meeting" to label your upcoming gathering. Remember, this title should be unique to distinguish it from other events. Moving along, direct your gaze towards the end date field, marked clearly as "DD/MM/YYYY", and click inside it. A handy date picker will pop up, allowing you to choose the perfect date for your meeting. After entering "10/10/2040", you'll see the date field update accordingly, confirming your selection. As we continue, find the end time field, which currently
  reads "--:--", and click there. A time picker will emerge, offering you a range of times to pick from. Scroll down and select "12" to set the end time to noon. With the time now set, shift your focus to the "Venue" textbox, which is now ready for you to fill in. Type "Venue" into this field to specify where the meeting will take place. Next up, the "Room" textbox awaits your input; click inside and type "Room" to complete the location details. If everything has been entered correctly, the room field should now display the unique room name you've chosen. For the event protection mode, simply click the "Public" option to ensure anyone can access the meeting. Finally, press the "Create event" button to save all your hard work. Voila! Your meeting is now officially created and stored in the system. To double-check everything, glance at the page heading and confirm that the meeting name you entered is prominently displayed. Additionally, make sure the venue and room information is 
  correctly shown on the meeting page, providing all necessary location details.
