description: "To begin, you'll want to interact with the workflows collapsible menu where the 'Call for Abstracts' option resides. Next, simply observe as the workflows menu expands, revealing its contents. For your reference, proceed by clicking the 'Call for Abstracts' link, which will lead you to the designated section. Understand that once you click the 'Enable module' button, the system will activate the corresponding feature. If you encounter an issue, ensure that the message stating 'The call for abstracts is not open yet' appears, confirming the initial status. A narrative unfolds as you press the 'Start now' button, initiating the call for abstracts process. Instructions are clear: after opening it, click the 'Close now' button to halt the process temporarily. An interesting twist occurs when you click the 'Reopen now' button; a confirmation dialog pops up unexpectedly. In a noisy, casual tone, just tap the close button in the 'Confirm action' dialog header to dismiss it. Finally,
  the call for abstracts is reopened, completing the cycle."
