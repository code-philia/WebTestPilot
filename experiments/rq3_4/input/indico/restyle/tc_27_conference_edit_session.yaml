description: To begin, you'll want to navigate by clicking the "Sessions" link found within the navigation bar. Once the Sessions section has opened up, proceed to click on the gear icon associated with the very first session listed. For your reference, upon clicking the gear icon, an edit form specific to the session should appear before you. Imagine now that you're focusing on the "Title" textbox; it's here where you'll find the current title already highlighted and ready for editing. If you encounter any issues at this point, simply clear the existing text and type "Session title updated123456" into the title field to update it accordingly. The magic happens next as you observe the title field dynamically reflecting the new session title you've just entered. With everything looking good, give the "Save" button a click to ensure all modifications are securely stored. To verify the success of your actions, take a moment to check the sessions table where the updated session title 
  should now be prominently displayed. And there you have it, folks, the sessions list now proudly shows off the newly updated title for all to see.
