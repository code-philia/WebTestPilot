description: To ensure accuracy, one must check if the meeting name is embedded within the event settings data. First, proceed to confirm that the meeting name is accurately displayed on the screen. For technical reference, the venue information should be clearly visible in the designated location section. Understanding why the venue name is crucial, it must appear in the event's location details. Once upon a time, there was a need to verify that the room information was also visible in the same location section. The room name, like a beacon, should be shown in the event location for clarity. If you encounter issues with navigation, make sure the event navigation elements are indeed present. An easy way to check is to see if the event navigation menu is available at your fingertips. In case you're looking for the timetable, don't worry; just ensure the link is available. Lastly, the timetable option should be present in the navigation, making everything accessible.
