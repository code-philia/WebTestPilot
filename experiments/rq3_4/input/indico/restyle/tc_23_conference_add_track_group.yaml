description: "To begin your journey, you'll want to click on the \"Programme\" link found within the navigation bar. Next, follow these instructions carefully: after the Programme section has opened, locate and click the \"Add track group\" link. For those seeking technical details, know that clicking this link will trigger the opening of the Track group creation form. Imagine now, you're in a story where you must focus the cursor in the \"Title\" textbox; it's like casting a spell to bring forth the input field. If you encounter any issues, remember that focusing the Title field simply means it’s ready for you to type \"Track group123456\" into it. The concept here is simple: once you've entered a unique track group name, you're ensuring its distinct identity among others. Now, proceed to the \"Description\" textbox and click inside it, making sure the field is focused for your next action. In a casual tone, just jot down \"Many papers about123456\" in the description field because, hey,
  we all need a bit of fun in our work. With the description field now containing your text, it's time to hit the \"Save\" button. Voila! Your track group is created and saved, like magic. To verify everything worked as expected, check if the newly created track group appears in the track list container. Lastly, ensure the track group description is visible, confirming that all your hard work is displayed for everyone to see."
