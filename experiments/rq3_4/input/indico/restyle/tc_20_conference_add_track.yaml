description: "To begin your journey into the world of programme management, you'll want to start by clicking the \"Programme\" link found within the navigation bar. Next, follow these instructions carefully: once the Programme section has opened, locate and click the \"Add track\" link. For those seeking technical guidance, it's important to note that upon clicking the \"Add track\" link, a form specifically designed for track creation will appear on your screen. Imagine now that you're an author, ready to give life to your creation; click inside the \"Title\" textbox, and watch as it becomes focused, awaiting your input. If you encounter any issues with the title field not focusing properly, simply ensure that no other elements are interfering with its functionality. With the title field now focused, type \"Track\" into it, ensuring that the field contains a unique name for your track. Moving forward, direct your attention to the \"Code\" textbox; click inside it, and the field will be
  focused, ready for you to enter the necessary information. To clarify the purpose of the next step, when you type \"OC\" into the code field, you're assigning a specific identifier to your track. As the narrative unfolds, click into the \"Description\" textbox, and feel the field come alive as it focuses, prepared for your creative input. After typing \"Papers about\" into the description field, you'll notice that it now holds the text you've entered, completing this part of the form. Finally, with all fields filled out, click the \"Save\" button, and like magic, your track will be created and stored away safely. To ensure everything went according to plan, verify that the newly created track appears in the track list container, which should now display the track you just added."
