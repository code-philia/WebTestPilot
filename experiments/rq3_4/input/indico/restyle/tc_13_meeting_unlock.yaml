Next, follow these steps carefully: after clicking the button, ensure the action menu dropdown has fully opened. For your reference, the 'Lock' option within this dropdown is crucial for proceeding with securing the meeting. Understand that once you select 'Lock', a confirmation dialog will appear, prompting you to finalize your decision. If you encounter any issues at this stage, simply click the 'Lock event' button to confirm the meeting's lock status. Once locked, a narrative unfolds where you might need to unlock it later; start by revisiting the action menu button. Now, imagine the dropdown opening again, revealing the options available for interaction. Lastly, in a more relaxed tone, just tap on 'Unlock' and watch as the system triggers the unlocking process seamlessly."
