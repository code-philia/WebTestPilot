Next, follow these instructions carefully: once the Sessions section has opened, locate and click the \"Contribution settings\" dropdown link in the navigation menu. For those seeking a technical reference, it's important to note that clicking this link will result in the Contribution settings dropdown being displayed. If you're curious about how everything works conceptually, think of it like opening a door to reveal more options; in this case, clicking the \"Session types\" link will unveil the Session types settings. Should you encounter any issues along the way, remember that clicking the \"New session type\" link should lead to the appearance of the Session add form. Once upon a time, there was a user who needed to fill out the \"Session type\" in the name field, and they did just that. In a casual tone, one might say that after filling the name field,
  you simply hit the \"Save\" button, and voila! Your session type is now created and saved. To ensure everything went smoothly, verify that the session type appears in the session types list, because seeing is believing. With a sense of finality, click the \"Close\" button to exit the Session types settings. Now, let's move on to adding a new session: click the \"Add new session\" button, which will open up the Session creation form. Focus your attention on the \"Title\" textbox by clicking inside it, as this action sets the stage for input. Type \"Session title\" into the title field, making sure it contains a unique identifier for your session. Afterward, direct your gaze to the \"Description\" textbox and click inside it to focus the field for typing. Type \"Session description\" into the description field, ensuring it contains meaningful text. Finally, click the \"Save\" button to create and save your session, and then double-check that it appears in the sessions table, confirming its
  existence among other sessions."
