Next, ensure that the login page appears with various authentication options available for selection. Now, focus on the task at hand: click inside the textbox that is clearly labeled \"Username or email\". The username field becomes active, indicating it's ready for you to type your credentials. Enter \"admin@admin.com\" into the username field, making sure it's correctly inputted. As expected, the username field now shows \"admin@admin.com\", confirming your entry. Move on to the password section by clicking in the textbox marked \"Password\". With the password field now focused, you're prepared to enter your secure information. Carefully type \"webtestpilot\" into the password field, keeping an eye on the display. The password field will show masked characters, protecting your sensitive data. After entering your details, proceed by clicking the \"Login with Indico\" button
  to authenticate. If everything goes smoothly, you'll be authenticated and whisked away to the dashboard like magic. To confirm your success, check if the \"My profile\" link is visible within the navigation area. Indeed, the visibility of the \"My profile\" link serves as a beacon, signaling that your login was successful."
