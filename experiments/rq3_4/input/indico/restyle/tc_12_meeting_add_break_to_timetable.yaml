description: To begin your journey through the scheduling interface, you'll want to click the "Timetable" link nestled within the navigation bar. Next up, you're instructed to click the "Add new" dropdown button, which will reveal the add new menu right before your eyes. For those seeking technical guidance, it's important to note that selecting the "Break" option will trigger the opening of the Break creation form. Imagine a story where you, the protagonist, decide to click into the "Title" textbox, and suddenly, the title field becomes focused, ready for your input. If you encounter any issues with typing "Break123456" in the title field, just remember that this step ensures the field contains a unique break name. Moving along, focus shifts to the "Description" textbox; simply click it to bring the description field into focus. An easy way to explain this next part is that after typing "Description123456" in the description field, you'll see that it now contains the text you've 
  entered. When you click in the time field marked "--:--", a magical time picker appears, allowing you to select "11" from its list. With the start time now set to 11:00, you're almost at the finish line; just click the "Save" button to create and save your break. To troubleshoot any doubts, verify that the newly created "Break" now appears in the timetable canvas. And there you have it, the timetable proudly displays the break entry, completing our little adventure.
