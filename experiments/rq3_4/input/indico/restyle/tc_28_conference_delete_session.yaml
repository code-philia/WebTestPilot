description: To begin, one must navigate to the 'Sessions' link found within the navigation bar. Once you click on it, the Sessions section will open up like a curtain revealing its contents. If you're looking for guidance on what should appear next, expect to see a message stating 'There are no sessions yet,' which is typically shown at the start. An empty sessions message is displayed, confirming the absence of any scheduled activities. Now, if you wish to add a new session, simply locate and click the 'Add new session' button, and voila! The session creation form magically appears before your eyes. Enter 'Session title123456' into the title field, ensuring that the field now contains the session title you've just typed. Moving along, fill the description field with 'Session description123456,' making sure the text is correctly placed. Afterward, hit the 'Save' button; this action will result in the session being created and stored away safely. Should you decide to remove the first 
  session, click the trash icon beside it, and a delete confirmation dialog will pop up, asking for your final decision. Confirm your choice by clicking the 'OK' button, thus finalizing the session's deletion. To ensure everything went as planned, check that the 'There are no sessions yet' message reappears, indicating the sessions list has been emptied once more.
