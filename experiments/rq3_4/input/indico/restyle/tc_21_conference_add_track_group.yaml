Next up, ensure the Programme section opens smoothly, setting the stage for further actions. For detailed instructions on proceeding, locate and click the "Add track group" link, which will trigger the opening of the track group creation form. Imagine now, focusing your attention on the "Title" textbox; it's time to click inside it, making the title field ready for your input. The title field, now focused, awaits your command—type "Track group" into it, ensuring the field contains a unique identifier for your new creation. Should you encounter any issues with the title not appearing correctly, double-check that you've typed the exact phrase "Track group" without any typos. Moving along, cast your gaze upon the "Description" textbox and click within it, bringing the description field into focus. With the description field now primed for action, type "Many papers about" into it,
  filling the space with meaningful content. Once the description field contains your text, prepare to finalize your work by clicking the "Save" button. Congratulations! Your track group has been created and saved successfully, a testament to your efforts. To verify everything went according to plan, check if the newly minted track group appears in the track list container, a visual confirmation of your success. Lastly, take a moment to appreciate the track group description, now clearly visible, a small but significant detail that completes the picture.
