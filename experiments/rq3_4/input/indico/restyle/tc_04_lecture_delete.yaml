description: To begin, locate and tap the action menu button, which is represented by three dots. The action menu dropdown will then appear, revealing various options for you to choose from. For your reference, ensure that the 'Delete' option is clearly visible within this dropdown list. Understanding the concept, the presence of the delete option signifies that it's accessible for selection. If you encounter any issues, make sure the 'Delete' option is not greyed out before proceeding. Once everything looks good, narratively speaking, imagine yourself clicking on the 'Delete' option, initiating the next step. With a casual approach, just check the box labeled 'I understand what this means'—it’s like agreeing to the terms before moving forward. After confirming, go ahead and click the 'Delete event' button, as if you're saying goodbye to the lecture forever. The system should now confirm the lecture deletion with an alert message stating 'Event successfully deleted'. Lastly, the 
  success alert serves as a confirmation, telling you that the lecture has indeed been removed from the schedule.
