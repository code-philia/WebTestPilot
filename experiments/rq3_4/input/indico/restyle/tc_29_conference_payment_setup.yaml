description: "To begin the process, you should click on the \"Registration\" link found within the navigation bar. Next, follow these instructions carefully: once the registration section is open, ensure that the \"Enable payments\" link is clearly visible to you. For reference, the presence of the payment enablement option confirms that the system is correctly configured at this stage. If you're wondering how to proceed, simply clicking the \"Enable payments\" link will trigger the appearance of a payment confirmation dialog box. In a narrative twist, imagine yourself pressing the \"OK\" button, which magically enables the payments feature. Now, casually navigate to the \"Payments\" link in the navigation menu; it's like finding a hidden treasure. Upon opening the payments configuration page, your task is to verify that the payment status is marked as \"enabled,\" indicating that the payment module is indeed active. Should you encounter any issues, check if the \"Bank Transfer disabled\"\
  \ link is visible, ensuring the bank transfer option remains accessible. By clicking the \"Bank Transfer disabled\" link, you'll be taken to the bank transfer configuration area, where you must check the \"Enabled\" checkbox to activate this feature. Focus on the \"Payment details\" textbox by clicking inside it, making sure the field is ready for input. Type \"Payment details\" into the field, entering the necessary information with precision. Finally, to save the payment settings, just click the \"Save\" button, securing all changes made."
