Once clicked, the system transitions into the Timetable view, unveiling a comprehensive schedule layout. Next up, follow these instructions carefully: click the \"Add new\" dropdown button to reveal additional options. An Add new menu magically appears, presenting various choices for your selection. For those seeking guidance, choose the \"Break\" option from the list to proceed with creating a new break period. Suddenly, a Break creation form pops up, ready for your input. Place your cursor in the \"Title\" textbox, and watch as the Title field becomes focused, awaiting your command. With the field now primed, type \"Break\" into it, ensuring the title field holds a unique identifier for this break session. Moving along, focus shifts to the \"Description\" textbox; click inside it to activate the field. Now that the Description field is focused, enter \"Description\" to fill
  it with relevant information. As we continue, click on the time field marked \"--:--\", which triggers the opening of a handy time picker tool. From the array of options in the time picker, select \"11\" to set the start time precisely at 11:00. With all details in place, give the \"Save\" button a firm click to finalize and store the new break entry. Lastly, to ensure everything went smoothly, check that \"Break\" is now visible on the timetable canvas. The timetable should now proudly display the newly added break entry, completing our task."
