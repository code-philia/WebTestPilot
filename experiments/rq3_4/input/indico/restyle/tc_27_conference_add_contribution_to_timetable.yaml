description: "To begin your journey through the system, you'll want to click on the \"Timetable\" link found within the navigation bar. Next up, follow these instructions carefully: once the Timetable view has opened, locate and click the \"Add new\" dropdown button. For those seeking a technical reference, the appearance of the Add new menu confirms that the system is functioning as expected. Let's delve into the concept here: selecting the \"Contribution\" option from the menu will trigger the opening of the Contribution creation form, a pivotal step in our process. Now, imagine a story where a user clicks inside the \"Title\" textbox, and suddenly, the title field becomes focused, ready for their input. If you encounter any issues, remember that typing \"Session Contribution\" into the title field should ensure the field contains a unique contribution name, solving any naming conflicts. In a casual tone, just hit that \"Save\" button when you're done, and boom! Your contribution is created
  and safely stored away. To troubleshoot, always verify that the newly created contribution pops up in the timetable canvas, adorned with its very own number prefix. Lastly, the timetable now proudly displays the numbered contribution, completing our task."
