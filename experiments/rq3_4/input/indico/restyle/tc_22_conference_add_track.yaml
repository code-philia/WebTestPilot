description: "To begin, you'll want to navigate your cursor over to the \"Programme\" link found within the navigation bar. Once the Programme section magically unfolds before your eyes, proceed to tap on the \"Add track\" link, which will unveil the Track creation form like a curtain revealing a stage. For technical reference, ensure your mouse pointer is precisely positioned over the \"Title\" textbox; upon clicking, the Title field should become active, awaiting your input. Let's dive into the conceptual understanding here: imagine typing \"Track123456\" into the title field, ensuring it stands out as a unique identifier among other tracks. Next up, follow these instructions carefully: click inside the \"Code\" textbox, making sure the Code field is now ready for your input. In case you encounter any issues, remember that typing \"OC\" into the Code field should resolve any lingering doubts about its contents. Now, let’s narrate this part: as you place your cursor in the \"Description\"\
  \ textbox, feel the focus shift, ready to capture your thoughts. With a flourish, type \"Papers about123456\" into the description field, filling it with meaningful content. Just casually hit the \"Save\" button, and voila! Your track is now created and safely stored away. To troubleshoot any uncertainties, double-check that the newly minted track pops up in the track list container, confirming its existence. Lastly, keep an eye out for the success alert message \"Track has been created,\" which serves as a digital handshake, confirming everything went off without a hitch."
