Next up, follow these instructions carefully: once the create event dropdown menu appears, make sure to click on the \"Conference\" option without delay. For those seeking a technical reference, it's worth noting that selecting the \"Conference\" option will trigger the opening of the conference creation form. Let me explain how this works conceptually: when you click inside the \"Event title\" textbox, the system focuses the event title field, preparing it for your input. If you encounter any issues at this stage, simply ensure that the title field is indeed focused before typing \"Conference\" into it. Once the title field contains the conference name, proceed to click in the end date field, which is conveniently labeled \"DD/MM/YYYY\". A narrative unfolds as the date picker becomes focused, awaiting your selection. Enter the date as \"10/10/2040\"\
  , and watch as the end date field magically updates to show \"10/10/2040\". Moving along casually, click in the end time field marked \"--:--\", and you'll see the time picker pop open like a friendly greeting. From there, just select \"12\" from the time picker, and boom! The end time is now set to 12:00. Now, focus your attention on the \"Venue\" textbox; it’s all ready for you to type \"Venue\" into it, making the venue field contain a unique venue name. With the venue sorted, let's not forget about the room: click in the \"Room\" textbox, where the field is focused and primed for your input. Type \"Room\" into this field, ensuring the room field contains its unique room name. When it comes to setting the event protection mode, just click the \"Public\" option, and voila, public protection mode is selected. Ready to finalize everything? Click the \"Create event\" button, and presto, your conference is created and saved. To verify everything went smoothly, check if the conference name
  pops up in the page heading. The conference page should display with the correct name in the heading, confirming your success. Lastly, don't forget to verify that the venue and room information is correctly displayed; location details should be clearly shown on the conference page."
