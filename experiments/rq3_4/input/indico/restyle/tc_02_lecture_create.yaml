description: To begin the process, one should click the "Create event" link found within the navigation bar. Next, you will observe the appearance of the create event dropdown menu; proceed to select the "Lecture" option from it. For those seeking guidance, the lecture creation form will open up after this step, allowing further action. Once the "Event title" textbox is clicked, the field becomes focused, awaiting your input with bated breath. It's important to note that typing "Lecture" into the title field ensures the field contains the unique name of the lecture, which is a critical step. Imagine a scenario where you're planning an event; clicking into the "Venue" textbox would naturally focus the field, preparing it for the venue name entry. The venue field, now focused, requires you to type "Venue" to fill it with the unique name of the location. Moving along, when the "Room" textbox is clicked, it too becomes focused, ready for you to type "Room" and complete the room name entry.
  Should you encounter any issues, selecting the "Public" option for the event protection mode will ensure it is set correctly for public access. After all fields are filled, clicking the "Create event" button finalizes the process, resulting in the lecture being created and saved successfully. A quick verification step involves checking if the lecture name appears prominently in the page heading, confirming everything is in order. The lecture page, now displaying the correct name in its heading, serves as a testament to the successful creation. Lastly, to ensure accuracy, one must verify that the lecture name "Lecture", along with the venue and room information, is correctly displayed on the page. The location details, including the venue and room names, are shown on the lecture page, completing the verification process.
