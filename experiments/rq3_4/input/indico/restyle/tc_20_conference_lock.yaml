description: To begin, you'll want to locate and click the action menu button, which is represented by three dots. Once clicked, an action menu dropdown will appear, revealing various options for your selection. Next, refer to the user interface guide and select the 'Lock' option from the list provided. A lock confirmation dialog box should then pop up, asking for final confirmation. Now, imagine yourself in the scenario where you must click the 'Lock event' button to proceed with securing the conference. After executing this step, the system confirms the conference locking process, ensuring no further changes can be made. To verify the success of this operation, look for the message stating 'This event has been locked,' which should appear prominently on the screen. The lock status message is a critical piece of information that gets displayed on the page, serving as a visual cue for users. If you encounter any issues, check for the alert message 'The event is now locked,' which acts 
  as a troubleshooting indicator for the locking mechanism. Lastly, in a casual tone, one might say, 'Yay! The success alert confirms everything went smoothly, and the conference is indeed locked.'
