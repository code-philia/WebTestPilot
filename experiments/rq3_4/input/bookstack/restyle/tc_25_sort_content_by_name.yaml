If you encounter any issues during this process, remember that choosing the correct sorting method is crucial for achieving the desired order. Once you've made your choice, proceed by clicking \"Apply\" or confirming your sort selection, ensuring everything is set for the next step. Finally, the magic happens as the system executes the sort by name operation, transforming the list before your eyes."
