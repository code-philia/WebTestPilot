Next, ensure that the book detail page appears, showcasing a comprehensive list of its contents for your perusal. For those seeking organization, proceed to click the \"Sort\" button, which is typically located near the top of the screen. Once the sort interface or dropdown menu emerges, it's time to make your choice; select the \"Sort by Name\" option from the list provided. With the name sorting option now highlighted, it indicates that your preference has been acknowledged by the system. To finalize your decision, click on the \"Apply\" button or find another way to confirm your sort selection—it’s the final step before the magic happens. The system then executes the sort by name operation, rearranging the items according to your command. Now comes the moment of truth: verify that the content is indeed sorted alphabetically, ensuring no item has been left
  out of place. As you scroll through the newly organized list, you’ll notice that both chapters and pages adhere to the alphabetical order, a testament to the system's thoroughness. Lastly, take a moment to confirm that all content types, without exception, follow the alphabetical order, completing your task with precision."
