description: To begin your journey through the library's digital interface, you should click the "Shelves" link found within the navigation menu. Once you've navigated there, expect to be greeted by a comprehensive list of all the shelves currently at your disposal. For those seeking specific guidance, simply locate and select the shelf titled "Shelf" from the array presented. Upon selection, the system will transition you to the shelf's detailed view, where you must confirm that the shelf's name is prominently featured as the page's main heading. It's crucial to understand that the shelf name serves not only as an identifier but also as the central element of the page's design. If you encounter any issues, such as the shelf description failing to appear, double-check that the text is indeed visible beneath the heading. In a story-like sequence, imagine finding Book1 nestled among the other treasures on the shelf, its presence confirmed by its listing. Moving along in our casual 
  exploration, let's also ensure that Book2 finds its place on the shelf, just as expected.
