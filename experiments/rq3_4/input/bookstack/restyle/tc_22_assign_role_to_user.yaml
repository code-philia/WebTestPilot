description: "To begin, you'll want to navigate your cursor over to the \"Settings\" link found within the navigation bar and give it a click. The Settings page will then appear before your eyes, ready for further interaction. Next up, follow these instructions carefully: locate and click on the \"Users\" option nestled within the settings menu. As the Users management section unfolds, you are presented with a list of users; choose one from this array to proceed. A magical transformation occurs as the User details page or edit form materializes, revealing all sorts of editable information about the chosen user. Now, if you're looking for the Edit button associated with the selected user, just give it a tap and watch as the User edit form slides into view. Within this form, there's a special section dedicated to roles—this is where you'll find the User roles selection area, patiently waiting for your input. Your task here is to pick out \"TestRole123456\" from the list of available roles
  like you're selecting a prize from a treasure chest. Once \"TestRole123456\" is highlighted, it signifies that the role has been successfully selected for assignment. With everything set, direct your attention to the \"Save\" button and press it firmly. The system acknowledges your action by saving the newly assigned user role. Keep an eye out for a success alert message stating \"User successfully updated\"—it's the system's way of confirming that the user update was indeed successful. To ensure everything is in order, double-check that the role has been correctly assigned to the user by observing their profile, which should now proudly display the assigned role. Just a heads-up though: full testing might be a bit tricky due to the demo restrictions in place. You see, the demo environment could throw a wrench in things by imposing certain permission limitations."
