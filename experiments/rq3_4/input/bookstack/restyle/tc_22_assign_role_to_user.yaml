description: To begin, you should navigate to the 'Users' option located within the settings menu. Once the users management section appears, it's time to focus on the user named Guest with the email guest@example.com. For your reference, upon selecting this specific user, an interface will emerge displaying either their detailed information or an editable form. Imagine now, as if in a story, that you are presented with a list of roles, and from this list, you choose the one labeled 'Role'. If you encounter any issues during this process, ensure that after selecting the desired role, it is indeed marked as chosen. Next up, proceed to click on the 'Save' button, which finalizes the changes made. An important step involves confirming that the role 'Role' has been successfully linked to the user Guest. Lastly, in a more relaxed tone, just double-check that Guest now proudly displays the newly assigned role 'Role'.
