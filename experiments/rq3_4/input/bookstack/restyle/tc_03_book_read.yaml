description: To begin your journey, simply click the "Books" link found within the navigation bar. Note that upon clicking, you will be presented with an exhaustive list of all the books currently available for perusal. For the next step, refer to the book titled "Book" and proceed to select it from the list. Imagine the scene where the book's detailed page magically unfolds before your eyes after your selection. Now, ensure that the page heading prominently displays the book name "Book" as expected. In case you encounter any issues, double-check that the main heading indeed reads "Book" as specified. The book description, containing the text "Description", should be clearly visible on the page; confirm its presence. Lastly, a quick glance at the book navigation elements will reveal their presence, ensuring everything is in order. The sidebar on the book detail page conveniently outlines the structure for easy navigation.
