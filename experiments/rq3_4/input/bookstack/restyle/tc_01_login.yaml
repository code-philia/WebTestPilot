Next, ensure the email field is active and prepared for typing—this step is crucial for proceeding. Simply key in "admin@admin.com" into the designated space, making sure every character is correct. Once entered, the email field will visually confirm "admin@admin.com", indicating readiness for the next phase. Now, shift your gaze to the password textbox, clearly labeled "Password", and click inside it. With the password field now focused, it’s primed for your input without any distractions. Carefully type "password" into this field, keeping an eye out for any errors. As expected, the password field will display masked characters, ensuring security and privacy. Afterward, direct your cursor to the "Log In" button and give it a firm click. Upon successful authentication, the user will be seamlessly transported to the dashboard, marking the completion of the login 
  process. To verify everything went smoothly, check if the "Books" link appears in the navigation bar. The visibility of the Books link serves as a reassuring sign that the login was indeed successful.
