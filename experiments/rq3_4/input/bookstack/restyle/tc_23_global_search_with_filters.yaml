description: To begin your journey through the digital library, you'll want to interact with the global search box located at the very top of the page. Next, ensure that the search input field is focused—this step is crucial for accurate data entry. Type "test" into the search field, making sure every letter is correctly entered. Once the search term is in place within the field, it's time to proceed to the next step. Now, click the "View All" button to reveal the search results page, where all relevant information will be displayed. As you verify the search results, you'll notice a list of matching items appearing before your eyes. To refine your search further, uncheck the "Chapter" checkbox, which is a simple toggle action on the interface. Confirm that the checkbox for "Chapter" has indeed been unchecked by observing its state. Afterward, click the "Update Search" button to refresh the results according to your new criteria. With the updated search, you'll see that only book items 
  are now displayed in the results. Troubleshoot any issues by ensuring no chapters appear in the search result list; if they do, retrace your steps. Lastly, verify that books are shown in the search result list, maintaining their presence as expected.
