description: To begin your journey through the digital library, you'll want to interact with the global search box located at the very top of the page. Next, ensure that the search input field is focused—this step is crucial for accurate data entry. Type "" into the search field; it's like casting a wide net to catch all possible results. Once the search term is entered, the search field will contain the specified query, ready for action. Now, click the 'Search' button, and watch as the magic unfolds before your eyes. The search results page is displayed, revealing a treasure trove of information. To verify the presence of 'Book', carefully scan the search results list, ensuring it appears as expected. As you continue your exploration, confirm that 'Chapter' is also listed among the search results. If you wish to refine your search, uncheck the 'Chapter' checkbox—it’s a simple toggle that filters out unwanted entries. After unchecking, the checkbox for 'Chapter' is indeed unchecked, 
  altering the search parameters. Click the 'Update Search' button to refresh the results according to your new criteria. The search results now exclusively showcase book items, a testament to the power of filtering. To double-check, verify that no chapters are shown in the search result list; they should be completely absent. Lastly, confirm that books are still prominently featured in the search result list, maintaining their rightful place amidst the filtered data.
