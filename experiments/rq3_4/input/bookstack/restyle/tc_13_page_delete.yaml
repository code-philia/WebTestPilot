description: To initiate the process, one must locate and click the "Delete" link within the page actions section. Next, you will observe a delete confirmation dialog popping up on your screen. For technical reference, ensure the "Confirm" button within this dialog is clicked to proceed with the deletion. Understand that once the "Confirm" button is pressed, the system acknowledges the page deletion request. A success story unfolds as an alert message reading "Page successfully deleted" materializes before your eyes. If you encounter any issues, check for the success alert which confirms the page has indeed been deleted. The narrative continues as we verify the user's redirection away from the now-deleted page. In a casual tone, it's worth noting that the user should no longer find themselves on the deleted page. Lastly, for verification purposes, confirm that the page is absent from the book navigation menu. The page is officially removed from the book's structural hierarchy.
