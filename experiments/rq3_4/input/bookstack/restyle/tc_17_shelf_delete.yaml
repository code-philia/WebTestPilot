description: "To initiate the process, one must click the \"Delete\" link located within the shelf actions menu. In technical terms, upon clicking the aforementioned link, a delete confirmation dialog box will materialize on the screen. Imagine you're in a story where the next step involves tapping the \"Confirm\" button that pops up in this dialog box. If you encounter any issues at this stage, ensure the \"Confirm\" button is clearly visible and responsive. The shelf deletion is now officially confirmed, marking a pivotal moment in our narrative. For those seeking a straightforward explanation, an alert message stating \"Shelf successfully deleted\" should appear to confirm the action. To verify success, check for the presence of an alert confirming the shelf's removal from the system. Afterward, the user finds themselves magically transported away from the now non-existent shelf page. In a casual tone, it's worth noting that the user won't be seeing that shelf page anymore because it's
  gone for good. Lastly, when referencing the shelves listing, make sure the recently deleted shelf no longer makes an appearance. The final outcome is clear: the shelf has been successfully removed from the shelves list."
