Next up, follow these instructions carefully: locate and click the \"Templates\" button situated on the right-hand side of the interface. For those seeking detailed information, the template configuration tab is where you'll find all the necessary settings and options laid out clearly. If you're wondering how to proceed, simply tick the checkbox labeled \"Page is a template\"—this action designates the current page as a template. Once the checkbox is checked, it's time to secure your changes by clicking the \"Save Page\" button. Should you encounter any issues, ensure that the success message \"Template successfully created\" pops up, confirming everything went smoothly. In a story-like manner, imagine yourself now moving forward to create a brand new page, whereupon the page creation form magically appears before your eyes. As you continue your journey, click the \"Templates\"\
  \ button once more on the right-hand side, and behold, the template configuration tab greets you again. Now, here comes the tricky part: click the \"Templates\" dropdown menu, and voila! The template selection dropdown unfolds its list of options. From this list, choose \"Template123456\", and just like that, the template is selected for your project. To make sure everything is working as expected, check that the page content is automatically filled with the template's details. The page editor should now display the template content, ready for your final touches. Finally, hit the \"Save Page\" button one last time, and presto! A page enriched with template content is born. Last but not least, keep an eye out for the alert message \"Page successfully created\" to appear, as it will be your confirmation that the process has been completed without a hitch."
