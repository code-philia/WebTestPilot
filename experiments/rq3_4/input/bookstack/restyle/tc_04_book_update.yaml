description: To begin, you should click the "Edit" button located within the book's action menu. Once the book edit form opens, proceed to click inside the "Name" textbox, where you'll find the cursor already focused and ready for input, containing the current name of the book. For those seeking guidance on how to update the book's title, simply clear the existing text and type "Book Updated", ensuring the field reflects your new entry accurately. Imagine a scenario where after typing the new name, the system instantly updates the display to show "Book Updated", confirming the change visually. Next up, focus shifts to the Rich Text Area iframe; here, you must click to bring up the rich text editor, which will then be ready for your input. With the rich text editor now focused, go ahead and clear any pre-existing content before typing "Description Updated", making sure the area is filled with your fresh description. After updating both fields, the final step involves clicking the "Save 
  Book" button, a crucial action that commits all modifications made to the book. Should everything proceed as expected, an alert message stating "Book successfully updated" will appear, serving as confirmation that the process was successful. To ensure the update was applied correctly, check the page heading, which should now proudly display the new name "Book Updated". Lastly, don't forget to verify that the updated description text is indeed visible, with "Description Updated" clearly shown on the page, completing the verification process.
