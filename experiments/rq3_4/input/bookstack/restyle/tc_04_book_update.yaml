description: To begin, you'll want to locate and click the 'Edit' link within the book's action menu; this step initiates the process of modifying the book details. Once the book edit form appears, it will display all the current values for easy reference. Next up, focus your attention on the 'Name' textbox by clicking inside it, ensuring you're ready to make the necessary updates. The Name field, now highlighted, holds the existing title but needs to be cleared before entering 'Book Updated 123456', transforming its content instantly. After typing the new name, the field refreshes to reflect 'Book Updated 123456', confirming the change visually. Now, shift your gaze to the Rich Text Area iframe and give it a click to bring up the rich text editor, your next target for modification. With the rich text editor now active, proceed to erase any pre-existing content and replace it with 'Description Updated', refreshing the area with the latest information. The Rich Text Area now proudly 
  displays the updated description, ready for finalization. Press the 'Save Book' button to commit these changes, sealing the deal on your edits. A success alert should pop up, reading 'Book successfully updated', serving as confirmation that everything went according to plan. To double-check, glance at the page heading, which should now echo the updated book name, solidifying the visual update. Lastly, ensure the updated description text is clearly visible on the page, completing the verification process with a satisfying nod to the successful update.
