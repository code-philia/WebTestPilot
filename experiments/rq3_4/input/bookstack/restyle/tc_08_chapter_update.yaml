description: "To embark on this journey, you must first locate and click the 'Edit' link nestled within the chapter actions, like a hidden treasure waiting to be discovered. Next, follow these precise instructions: once the Chapter edit form appears, populated with the current values, proceed to click inside the 'Chapter Name' textbox. For those seeking technical guidance, it's important to note that upon clicking, the Name field will automatically gain focus, revealing its current contents for your review. Imagine the field as a chameleon; it now displays the updated chapter name 'Chapter Updated' after you've cleared the old name and typed the new one. Should you encounter any issues, remember that clearing the name field and entering 'Chapter Updated' should resolve any display discrepancies. The narrative unfolds as you then click into the Rich Text Area iframe, where the rich text editor springs to life, awaiting your command. With a clear vision of your goal, wipe away the existing
  content and boldly write 'Chapter Description Updated', transforming the space before your eyes. Reference materials confirm that the Rich text area now faithfully mirrors the updated description you've just inputted. As the final act in this saga, press the 'Save Chapter' button, sealing the changes you've made with an irreversible stamp. To ensure everything has gone according to plan, cast your gaze upon the page heading, which should now proudly display the updated chapter name. In a casual check, you'll find that the chapter page indeed shows the new name in its heading, a testament to your efforts. Lastly, verify that the updated description text is visible, completing the circle of this task, as the updated description is now clearly displayed on the page."
