description: To begin your journey through the digital library, start by navigating from the dashboard and tapping the "Books" link nestled within the navigation menu. Next, you'll find yourself on the Books listing page; ensure that the "Create New Book" link is clearly visible before proceeding. For those seeking technical guidance, it's crucial to confirm the availability of the Create New Book option at this stage. If you encounter any issues, remember that clicking the "Create New Book" link should seamlessly transition you to the book creation form. Once there, a narrative unfolds as you click into the "Name" textbox, where the cursor eagerly awaits your input. With the Name field now focused, simply type "Book" to fill the field with your chosen title. Moving forward, focus your attention on the Rich Text Area iframe, which must be clicked to bring the rich text editor to life, ready for your creative content. As the rich text area now holds "Description", it's time to expand 
  the tags section by clicking the "▸ Book Tags" button, unveiling a new realm of categorization options. The next step involves clicking into the "Tag Name" textbox, where the field will be focused, awaiting your input of "env". After typing "env" into the tag name field, proceed to the tag value field, entering "test" to complete the tag details. Finally, press the "Save Book" button, culminating in the creation and saving of your book. To verify success, check that the page heading proudly displays the book name "Book". Confirm that the book page accurately reflects the name "Book" in its heading, ensuring all details align. Lastly, make sure the "Description" text is visible on the page, confirming that the book description "Description" is correctly displayed.
