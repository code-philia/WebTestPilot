description: "To begin, you'll want to navigate by clicking the \"Settings\" link found within the navigation bar. Once the Settings page is displayed, proceed to click on \"Roles & Permissions\" from the settings menu, which will open up the corresponding section. For those needing a technical reference, the next step involves interacting with the UI element labeled \"Create New Role\" button, resulting in the appearance of the role creation form. Imagine a story where a user clicks into the \"Role Name\" textbox, and suddenly, the field becomes focused, ready for input. Now, let's get a bit noisy and casual: just type \"TestRole123456\" into that name field, making sure it’s a unique identifier for your new role. To explain the concept clearly, once you've entered the role name, focus shifts to the \"Role Description\" textbox; click there to bring it into focus. Troubleshoot any issues by ensuring the description field is indeed focused before typing \"Test role for automation\" into
  it. With the description field now containing the role description, move on to select the necessary permission checkboxes for the role, checking them off one by one. Follow the procedure meticulously and click the \"Save Role\" button, which will create and save your new role. An alert message reading \"Role successfully created\" should appear; verify this to confirm the success of your actions. In a narrative twist, imagine seeing your newly created role now appearing in the roles listing, a testament to your efforts. Lastly, check that the role permissions are correctly set by verifying that the role shows all the assigned permissions accurately."
