description: To begin, you'll want to navigate your cursor over to the 'Settings' link nestled within the navigation bar and give it a good click. The Settings page is now displayed before your eyes, ready for further interaction. For those seeking detailed instructions, proceed by clicking on the 'Roles' option found within the settings menu. Imagine the Roles section magically opening up, revealing its contents like a treasure chest. Now, focus your attention on the 'Create New Role' button and press it firmly with your mouse. The Role creation form appears, awaiting your input. Place your cursor inside the 'Role Name' textbox, and watch as the field becomes focused, ready for typing. Type the word "Role" into the name field, and behold, the field now contains the name you've entered. Next, direct your gaze to the 'Role Description' textbox and click within it, causing the field to gain focus. With the description field now focused, type "Role description" and see the words 
  materialize within the field. Ensure the checkbox next to the button labeled 'Manage all book, chapter & page permissions' is checked, granting the necessary permissions. Scroll down the page until you spot the 'Toggle All' button under the 'Shelves' text, then click it to check all permissions in the shelves section. Moving along, find the 'Toggle All' button under the 'Books' text and click it, thereby checking all permissions in the books section. Continue this process by clicking the 'Toggle All' button under the 'Chapters' text, ensuring all permissions in the chapters section are checked. Lastly, click the 'Toggle All' button under the 'Pages' text, completing the permission checks for the pages section. Scroll down once more and click the 'Save Role' button, finalizing the creation and saving of the new role. To verify success, check if the role named 'Role' appears in the roles listing, confirming its addition. The new role should now be listed in the roles table, ready for 
  use.
