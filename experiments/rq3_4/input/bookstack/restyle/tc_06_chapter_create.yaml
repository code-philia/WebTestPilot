description: To embark on your literary journey, simply press the "New Chapter" button. Next, you'll observe the Chapter creation form magically appearing before your eyes. For those seeking precise instructions, ensure you click within the "Chapter Name" textbox now. The Chapter name field, once clicked, becomes the focal point for your input. Understand that typing "Chapter" into this field will assign it a unique identifier among other chapters. Now, direct your attention to the Rich Text Area iframe and give it a click. Once the rich text editor gains focus, proceed to type "Chapter Description" within its bounds. Confirm that the rich text area now holds the text "Chapter Description" as intended. Should you wish to expand the Chapter Tags section, just click the "▸ Chapter Tags" button. With the Chapter tags section now expanded, move your cursor to the "Tag Name" textbox and click. The tag name field, now ready for action, awaits your input. Enter "Sample Tag" into the tag name 
  field to label your creation accordingly. To complete the tagging process, click inside the tag value field and type "Sample Tag" again. After ensuring the tag value field mirrors "Sample Tag", it's time to finalize your work by clicking the "Save Chapter" button. Congratulations! Your chapter has been successfully created and stored away. To verify everything went smoothly, check if the chapter titled "Chapter" now graces the book navigation. The chapter should be neatly listed within the book's structure, confirming its addition. Lastly, navigate to the chapter page and marvel at the heading, which should proudly display the correct name "Chapter".
