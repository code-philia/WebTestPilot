description: "To embark on this journey, one must first select the desired destination chapter from the dropdown menu, like choosing a path in an ancient tale. Next, follow these clear instructions: ensure the chapter is selected as your destination before proceeding. For technical reference, remember that clicking the 'Move Page' button will trigger the page move operation. Let's delve into understanding why this step is crucial: initiating the page move operation sets the stage for the subsequent verification process. If you encounter any issues, check for the success alert message stating 'Page successfully moved,' which should appear without fail. The narrative continues as we navigate to the destination chapter, where the chapter detail page greets us with its familiar layout. In a straightforward manner, verify that the moved page now appears in its new destination, confirming the relocation. Now, casually speaking, the page is officially listed under the destination chapter, making
  it part of its new family. To wrap up our adventure, navigate back to the original book, where the original book page is displayed once more. As a final troubleshooting tip, make sure the page no longer appears in its original location, indicating successful removal. And there you have it; the page is removed from its original location, completing our odyssey."
