description: To remove a book, one must initiate the process by selecting the 'Delete' link found within the book's action menu. Next, you will encounter a dialog box seeking your confirmation for the deletion—this is where you should click the 'Confirm' button to proceed. For those familiar with software testing, this step involves validating that the system correctly processes the delete request upon confirmation. If you're wondering why the page changes, it's because the system redirects users after successfully deleting a book, ensuring they don't remain on a non-existent page. Imagine a scenario where a user clicks delete; the magic happens behind the scenes, and suddenly, they find themselves on a different page, confirming the book is gone. Lastly, just to make sure everything went as planned, casually check that you're not staring at the old book page anymore—it should be clear you've moved on.
