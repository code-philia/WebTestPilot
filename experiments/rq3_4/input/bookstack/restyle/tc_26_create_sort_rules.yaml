Once the Settings page materializes before your eyes, proceed to locate and select the 'Sort Rules' option or any similar alternative that might be available. For those seeking precise instructions, ensure you now focus on clicking the 'Create New Sort Rule' button, which will unveil the sort rule creation form for your interaction. Imagine a scenario where you've just clicked into the 'Rule Name' textbox; suddenly, it's as if the field itself is calling out for your attention, ready to receive input. Now, let's get technical for a moment: input the string \"SortRule123456\" directly into the rule name field, ensuring its uniqueness within the system's parameters. With the rule name firmly in place, turn your attention to the dropdown menu adjacent to 'Sort type,' where you must choose an option like 'Name,' 'Created,' or 'Updated' to define how items
  will be organized. In case you're encountering issues with sorting preferences, simply select either 'Ascending' or 'Descending' from the sort order options to clarify your desired arrangement. As we weave through this process, remember to select the entities—be they 'Books,' 'Chapters,' or 'Pages'—to which this rule will apply, making sure they align with your organizational goals. After all selections have been made, a final step awaits: click the 'Save Sort Rule' button, culminating in the creation and storage of your new sort rule within the system. Upon successful execution, keep an eye out for an alert message stating 'Sort rule successfully created,' serving as confirmation that everything has gone according to plan. Lastly, to ensure completeness, take a moment to scan the sort rules listing, where your newly minted rule should now be comfortably seated among its peers in the rules table."
