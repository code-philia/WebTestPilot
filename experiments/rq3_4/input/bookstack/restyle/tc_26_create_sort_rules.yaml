Instructions for the next step are straightforward: once the Settings page loads, locate and select the 'Sorting' option or any similar choice available. For those seeking detailed technical guidance, the Sort rules management section will now be accessible upon clicking the aforementioned option. Imagine a scenario where you're embarking on a journey to create order from chaos; in this narrative, clicking the 'Create Sort Rule' button is akin to opening a new chapter. Now, let's get conceptual for a moment: focusing on the 'Name' textbox is like setting the stage for what's to come in terms of organizing data. In a more casual tone, just type 'Rule' into the name field – nothing fancy, just keep it simple. If you're ever stuck and need troubleshooting advice, remember that after typing the name, the field should indeed reflect the text you've entered.
  Next up, add some spice to your list by clicking the button that introduces 'Name - Alphabetical (Asc)' into the mix. Narrative continues as you seamlessly add 'Created Date (Asc)' to the list with another button press, expanding your sorting criteria. In case you're wondering how to finalize everything, just hit the 'Save' button and voilà! Your sort rule is now officially created and stored away. To ensure everything’s working as expected, take a peek at the sort rules listing and confirm that 'Role' is indeed present. Lastly, in an expository fashion, one can state that the newly crafted sort rule now finds its place within the rules table, completing the task."
