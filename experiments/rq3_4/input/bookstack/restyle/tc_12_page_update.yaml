description: To begin, you'll want to locate and click the 'Edit' link found within the page actions section. Next, proceed to interact with the 'Page Name' textbox by clicking inside it; this action will focus the name field which currently displays the existing page title. For reference, the name field is now highlighted and ready for input, containing the old name until you decide to clear it and enter "Page Updated 123456". Imagine the name field magically refreshing to reveal your newly typed page name after you've made the change. Now, let's shift our attention to the Rich Text Area iframe—click inside it to bring up the rich text editor. If you encounter any issues where the existing content refuses to disappear, simply clear it out and type "Page Content Updated" to ensure everything is set correctly. The rich text area should now proudly display your updated content, confirming the successful replacement of the old text. Moving forward, press the 'Save Page' button to commit 
  these alterations. Once the page has been saved, keep an eye out for the success alert message stating "Page successfully updated", which serves as confirmation that all changes have been applied. In a narrative twist, the page heading transforms before your eyes, now bearing the updated page name as if by magic. Lastly, take a moment to casually check that the updated content text is indeed visible, ensuring that your efforts have resulted in the page displaying the new information.
