The book detail page emerges, showcasing a list of its contents for your perusal. For those seeking technical guidance, locate and press the \"Sort\" button to unveil the sorting interface. Imagine a scenario where you encounter an issue: clicking the first \"Move Up\" button should resolve any sorting anomalies by altering the order. In a step-by-step guide, after adjusting the order, proceed to click the second \"Move Down\" button to further modify the sequence. Let me tell you a little story about a user who, after rearranging items, decided to click the second \"Move Up\" button, thus changing the sort order once more. If you're curious about how things work under the hood, clicking the \"Save New Order\" button commits all the changes made to the sorting preferences. And just like that, the new arrangement is preserved, ensuring
  everything is in its rightful place."
