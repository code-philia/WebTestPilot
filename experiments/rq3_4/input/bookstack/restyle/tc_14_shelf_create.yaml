Once there, you'll be greeted by the Shelves listing page; it’s like entering a room filled with endless possibilities for book organization. Next up, follow these instructions carefully: locate and click the 'New Shelf' button, which will trigger the opening of the shelf creation form, your canvas for creating a new storage space for your books. Now, focus on the 'Shelf Name' textbox; it's time to give your new shelf an identity by typing in 'Shelf123456', ensuring that the name field captures a unique identifier for your shelf. Should you encounter any issues where the shelf name isn’t being accepted, double-check that 'Shelf123456' is correctly entered without any extra spaces or characters. Moving along, shift your attention to the Rich Text Area iframe and click inside it, allowing the rich text editor
  to become the center of your focus for adding a description. With the rich text area now ready, input 'Shelf Description' to give your shelf some character and context. Expand the Shelf Tags section by clicking the '▸ Shelf Tags' button, unveiling a new area where you can categorize your shelf further. As the tag name field comes into focus, enter 'shelf' to label your creation appropriately within the system. In the tag value field, type 'test' to assign a specific attribute to your shelf, making sure the field reflects this exact entry. To manage the books associated with your shelf, click the '▸ Books' button, expanding the section to reveal all available books at your disposal. Highlight the books you wish to add to your shelf by selecting them, transforming them into part of your collection. After making your selections, proceed to save your shelf by clicking the 'Save Shelf' button, finalizing your creation. Upon successful creation, an alert message stating 'Shelf successfully created'
  should pop up, serving as a confirmation that everything went according to plan. Lastly, take a moment to verify that the shelf page displays the correct name in its heading, ensuring that your hard work is accurately represented. And there you have it, your newly created shelf now proudly showcases the selected books, completing the circle of your digital library management."
