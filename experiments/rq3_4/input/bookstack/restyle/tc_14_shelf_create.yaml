description: "To begin, one must navigate to the 'Shelves' section by clicking the corresponding link in the navigation bar. Next, you should observe the appearance of the Shelves listing page, confirming its successful loading. For creating a new shelf, proceed by clicking the 'New Shelf' button, which will trigger the opening of the shelf creation form. The 'Shelf Name' textbox is where your focus should be next; click inside it to ensure it's ready for input. Now, let’s dive into the conceptual part: imagine typing \"Shelf\" into the name field, making sure the field captures this exact name. Moving on, direct your attention to the Rich Text Area iframe and click within it, thus focusing the rich text editor for further actions. A common issue users face is not seeing their input reflected; to avoid this, type \"Shelf Description\" in the rich text area, ensuring it accurately contains the specified text. An exciting moment arrives when you click the \"▸ Books\" button, expanding the
  books section to reveal all available titles. With the books section now expanded, find the add button for Book1 and click it, adding this book to your shelf collection. Similarly, repeat the process for Book2 by clicking its add button, thus enriching your shelf further. To finalize the creation, press the 'Save Shelf' button, securing your shelf with all selected books. Upon saving, the shelf page should display, featuring the correct name prominently in the heading—a crucial step for verification. In a narrative twist, imagine yourself as a librarian checking if Book1 is indeed listed in the shelf, confirming its presence. Lastly, perform a quick check to ensure Book2 also finds its place among the listed books, completing the verification process."
