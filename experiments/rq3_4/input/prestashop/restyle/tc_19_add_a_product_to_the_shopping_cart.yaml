Next up, you'll find yourself on the product detail page for that very item; it’s here where all the magic happens, displaying every detail you could wish to know about the product.

Once the size is successfully selected, you’ll notice a subtle change confirming your choice, a small victory in the grand scheme of online shopping. Moving along, check a \"Color\" radio button to customize your selection further, adding a splash of personality to your purchase. If everything goes according to plan, the color will be successfully selected, allowing you to proceed with confidence. Now comes the exciting
  part: click the \"Add to cart\" button, and watch as your digital basket fills up with your chosen treasure. Finally, if all has gone well, a modal should appear with the title \"Product successfully added\", bringing a satisfying conclusion to your shopping adventure."
