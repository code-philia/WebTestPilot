Next up, you'll notice the Catalog submenu items expand like magic; it's almost as if they're waiting for your next move. For those seeking detailed instructions, proceed to click the \"Brands & Suppliers\" submenu item without delay. Understand that once this action is performed, the Brands & Suppliers page will be displayed before your eyes. If you encounter any issues, remember that clicking on the \"Add new brand\" button should lead to a new page appearing seamlessly. Imagine entering the brand name, say \"Nike,\" into the \"Name\" field—it’s like giving birth to a new identity. The name of the brand, a simple yet crucial detail, must be entered accurately. Now, let's dive into the technicalities: fill the complex description of the brand into the rich text editor within the \"Description\" area. With everything set, all that remains is to click the \"Save\" button—think of it as sealing
  the deal. Lastly, a success message reading \"Successful creation\" will grace the top of the page, confirming your triumphant endeavor."
