description: "To begin your journey through the system's interface, you'll want to head over to the 'Catalog' menu first. Next, ensure you follow these instructions carefully: proceed to click on 'Brands & Suppliers'. For those seeking a technical guide, it's important to note that after this step, you must interact with the 'Add new brand' button. Imagine a scenario where a new page magically materializes before your eyes, ready for your input. Now, let’s get conceptual for a moment: the field labeled 'Name' is where you breathe life into your brand by typing its name, say 'Nike'. Reference materials would tell you that the next logical step involves the 'Description' area, where the essence of the brand is captured in words. If you encounter any issues, remember that filling out the rich text editor with a detailed brand description can sometimes be tricky, but it’s crucial for clarity. Moving along in our narrative, the next task is to upload an image file for the brand's 'Logo', adding
  a visual identity to your creation. Just for your information, once the logo is uploaded, the 'Logo' field will conveniently show the filename of your chosen image. Lastly, in a casual tone, don’t forget to hit the 'Save' button when you’re done! And there you have it—a confirmation message reading 'Successful creation' will pop up at the top of the page, celebrating your achievement."
