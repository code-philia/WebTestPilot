Next, follow these instructions carefully: locate and click the \"Categories\" option within the menu. For those seeking technical guidance, the \"Add new category\" button is situated in the top-right corner—click it now. Imagine a blank canvas appearing before you as a new page for creating a category materializes. Now, let’s get creative: type \"Shoes\" into the \"Name\" field, bringing your vision to life with just a few keystrokes. Once \"Shoes\" is entered, you’ll feel a sense of accomplishment as the category name is successfully captured. If you encounter any issues expanding the category tree, simply click the \"Expand\" button in the \"Parent Category\" area—it’s your key to unlocking further options. With the category tree now fully expanded, it’s time to select \"Home\" as the parent category, ensuring your new addition
  fits perfectly within the existing structure. To add depth to your category, enter a description in the \"Description\" area, allowing the rich text editor to transform your words into engaging content. When it comes to uploading a \"Category cover image\", remember that the filename will be displayed in the upload area, serving as a visual identifier for your category. Create a memorable path by entering \"shoes\" in the \"Friendly URL\" field, making sure it’s easily accessible to all. After \"shoes\" is successfully entered, take a moment to appreciate your handiwork before clicking the \"Save\" button. Finally, if everything has been done correctly, a \"Successful creation\" message should appear, confirming that your new category is now live."
