Instructions: After clicking 'Catalog', observe as the submenu items elegantly expand before your eyes. For reference, the next step involves selecting the 'Categories' submenu item with a precise click. Imagine a magical Categories page materializing right before your eyes after you've clicked the correct option. If you're feeling adventurous, head over to the top-right corner and press the 'Add new' button to summon a new category creation page. Picture this: a blank canvas awaits your input as you type 'Shoes' into the 'Name' field, bringing life to your new category. Technically speaking, once 'Shoes' is entered, the system acknowledges its presence without any hiccups. Should you encounter any issues, simply click the 'Expand' button within the 'Parent Category' area to reveal the hidden category tree. Once upon a time, there was a user who selected 'Home' as the parent category
  from an expanded tree, and all was well in their digital world. Conceptually, filling the 'Description' area with a fitting narrative for your category is akin to painting a picture with words. Watch as the rich text editor fills up with your carefully crafted description, transforming plain text into engaging content. Now, for the visual aspect, upload a 'Category cover image' to give your category a face. Troubleshoot any upload issues by ensuring the filename appears correctly in the designated area. In a casual tone, let's say you enter 'shoes' as the custom URL, making sure it's both catchy and SEO-friendly. With 'shoes' now occupying the Friendly URL field, everything aligns perfectly like pieces of a puzzle. Finally, hit the 'Save' button with confidence, and behold the 'Successful creation' message that confirms your victory."
