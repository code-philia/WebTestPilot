Next, follow these instructions carefully: Click the 'Products' submenu to proceed further into the product management interface. For those seeking technical guidance, it's important to note that upon clicking the 'New product' button, a modal will appear, prompting you to select the product type. Imagine a scenario where you're creating a new item; a modal pops up, asking you to choose between various product types, and you select 'Standard product'. Reference material indicates that after choosing the 'Standard product' option, the system confirms your selection automatically. If you encounter any issues during this process, remember that clicking the 'Add new product' button should load the product creation page without any hiccups. Once there, casually fill in 'cat notebook' in the 'Name' field, as if you're jotting down notes in your
  personal diary. Now, let’s move on to uploading an image: 'cat notebook.jpg' should be chosen as the product picture, and voila! A thumbnail magically appears beside it. To ensure the product has all necessary details, enter both the summary and a comprehensive description, painting a vivid picture of what the product entails. When you're ready to categorize your creation, click the 'Add categories' button, and like magic, a modal window will pop up with various category options. In this step-by-step guide, you'll find that checking off one or more category checkboxes, such as 'Stationery', is crucial for accurate product placement. After making your selections, simply click the 'Apply' button, and the modal will disappear, leaving behind the selected categories neatly displayed on the product page. As we continue our adventure, click the 'Brand' dropdown to reveal a list of available brands. From this list, 'Graphic Corner' should be selected, solidifying the product's identity. Transitioning
  smoothly, tap the 'Details' tab to dive deeper into the specifics of your product. Feeling adventurous? Click the 'Add a feature' button to unveil a new row dedicated to adding unique features. From the 'Choose a feature' dropdown, pick 'Composition' to highlight an essential aspect of your product. Moving along, select 'Recycled cardboard' from the 'Choose a value' dropdown to specify the composition material used. Ready for the next phase? Click the 'Stocks' tab to manage inventory levels efficiently. Input '300' into the quantity field to set the stock level accurately. For pricing aficionados, switch to the 'Pricing' tab and input the retail price '12.90' and wholesale price '5.49' to complete the financial details. Lastly, head over to the 'Shipping' tab and enter '0.3' into the shipping weight field to finalize the logistics. With everything in place, click the 'Save' button, and you’ll be greeted with a 'Successful update' message, confirming that your hard work has paid off."
