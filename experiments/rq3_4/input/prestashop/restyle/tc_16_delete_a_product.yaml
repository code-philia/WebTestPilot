description: "Imagine embarking on a journey where you must enter 'bird' into the product name filter, like a secret code to unlock hidden treasures. In technical terms, ensure the product name filter is populated after inputting the specified term. Next, follow these instructions carefully: locate and click the 'Search' button within the product list interface. To understand why this step is crucial, consider that clicking the data row for 'bird' ensures the system accurately identifies your target among countless entries. If you encounter issues locating the correct row, remember that the 'more actions' button, identifiable by its three-dot icon, is your key to accessing further options on that specific row. A narrative unfolds as you click the 'Delete' option; a dropdown menu magically appears, presenting you with choices. Should a confirmation dialog appear unexpectedly, simply click the final 'Delete' button within it to affirm your decision. Lastly, in a casual tone, one might say
  that seeing a 'Successful deletion' message confirms the product's removal, bringing closure to this digital adventure."
