description: "To begin your journey through the interface, you'll want to interact with the 'Catalog' menu first. Next, follow these instructions carefully: expand the Catalog submenu by clicking it. For those seeking detailed technical guidance, note that selecting the 'Products' submenu will lead you to the product list page, which should display without any issues. Imagine a scenario where you're a detective looking for clues; entering 'bird' into the filter and hitting Search will refresh the list to reveal only the relevant products. Once you've found the data row for the specific product, you'll know you're on the right track because the target row will be correctly located. Now, let's dive into some practical advice: when you see the three-dot icon on that row, give it a click to reveal a dropdown menu featuring the 'Delete' option. If you encounter any problems at this stage, remember that clicking the 'Delete' option from the dropdown menu should trigger a confirmation dialog. In
  a narrative twist, our protagonist must now face the ultimate decision by clicking the final 'Delete' button in the dialog to confirm their action. And there you have it—a 'Successful deletion' message appears, confirming that the product has been removed from the list, bringing our story to a satisfying conclusion."
