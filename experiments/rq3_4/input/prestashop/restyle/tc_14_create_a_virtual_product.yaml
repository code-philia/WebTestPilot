For reference purposes, note that upon clicking, the product list page should appear without any issues. Let me explain what happens next: When you click the 'New product' button, expect a modal window to pop up for choosing the product type. If you encounter any problems, ensure that the 'Virtual product' option is clicked to select the correct product type. Once the 'Virtual product' type is chosen, everything should be in order. Now, let’s move on with the story: After clicking the 'Add new product' button to confirm your choice, the product creation page will load automatically. Simply enter 'bird' into the 'Name' field, and the system will register it. To fill in the product's description, just type \"Description\" into the designated area. Don’t forget to click the 'Add categories' button, which
  will bring up the category selection modal. In a noisy environment, make sure the 'Art' category checkbox is checked properly. After checking the 'Art' box, click the 'Apply' button to close the modal. When you click the 'Brand' section, a list of options will appear; from there, choose 'Graphic Corner' as your preferred brand. Switching tabs is straightforward: Click the 'Details' tab to change the view accordingly. Type 'test1' into the 'Reference' field to complete this step successfully. Navigate to the 'Virtual product' tab by clicking it, and the view will switch automatically. Input '300' into the quantity field to set the stock level accurately. Move to the 'Pricing' tab by clicking it, and the view will adjust as expected. Enter the retail price as '9.000000' and the wholesale price as '5.49' to fill in the price details. For clarification, input the wholesale price '5.490000' again to ensure accuracy. Transition to the 'SEO' tab by clicking it, and the view will switch seamlessly.
  Fill in 'bird-vector-graphics' in the Friendly URL field to create an SEO-friendly link. From the 'Redirection when offline' dropdown, select 'default' as the preferred option. Click the 'Options' tab to access additional settings. Check the 'Accessories supplier' checkboxes to associate them with the product. Similarly, check the 'Fashion supplier' checkboxes to link them appropriately. Enter 'test1' as the virtual product fashion supplier reference to provide specific supplier data. Set the virtual product fashion supplier price to '6.490000' for accurate supplier pricing. Finally, click the 'Save' button, and you should see a 'Successful update' message confirming the changes."
