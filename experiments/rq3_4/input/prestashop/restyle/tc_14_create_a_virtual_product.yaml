Next, follow these instructions carefully: Click the 'Products' submenu to proceed. For those seeking technical guidance, note that clicking the 'New product' button will trigger a modal for selecting the product type. Imagine a scenario where you're adding a new item; you'd then click the 'Virtual product' option, making it the chosen type. If you encounter any issues, remember that clicking the 'Add new product' button should confirm your selection and load the product creation page. Once there, enter 'bird' into the 'Name' field, ensuring the product name is captured accurately. To add an image, simply upload 'bird.jpg', and voila! A thumbnail will appear beside your entry. Now, let’s fill in the summary and description fields, providing all necessary details about the product. Afterward, click the 'Add categories' button, which will bring up the category
  selection modal. In this modal, check the 'Art' category checkbox to associate it with your product. Once done, click the 'Apply' button to close the modal and save your selections. Moving on, open the 'Brand' dropdown and select 'Graphic Corner' to finalize the brand association. Switch over to the 'Details' tab by clicking it, allowing you to input more specific information. Enter 'test1' into the 'Reference' field, marking another successful step in the process. Navigate to the 'Virtual product' tab next, where you’ll find options specific to virtual products. Set the stock quantity by entering '300' into the quantity field, ensuring ample inventory. Transition to the 'Pricing' tab to handle financial details, entering '9.00' for the retail price and '5.49' for the wholesale price. For SEO optimization, head to the 'SEO' tab and enter 'bird-vector-graphics' into the Friendly URL field. When considering offline scenarios, select 'default' from the 'Redirection when offline' dropdown
  for seamless user experience. Lastly, under the 'Options' tab, check the 'Fashion supplier' checkboxes and fill in the reference and price for each supplier before clicking the 'Save' button, which will display a 'Successful update' message at the top of the page."
