Next, follow these instructions carefully: after clicking 'Catalog', ensure that the submenu items expand properly, revealing further choices for you to select from. For those seeking detailed technical guidance, it's important to note that selecting the 'Attributes & Features' submenu item will direct you to a specialized page dedicated to these elements. Imagine a scene where, upon reaching the Attributes & Features page, you find yourself ready to embark on adding a new value, simply by clicking the button located in the top-right corner of your screen. If you're encountering issues with navigation, remember that a new page should appear, complete with a form designed specifically for creating a new value; if it doesn’t, check your previous steps. Now, let’s dive into the specifics: you’ll need to interact with the 'Attribute group'
  drop-down list, a crucial step in defining the characteristics of your new value. Reference material indicates that once you activate the drop-down list, a comprehensive array of attribute groups will be presented before your eyes. To proceed, conceptualize the selection process as choosing 'Weight' from the 'Attribute group' drop-down list, aligning your choice with the desired attribute category. Confirm that 'Weight' is indeed highlighted as the selected attribute group within the drop-down list, ensuring accuracy in your setup. With a casual approach, just type a specific value like '500g' into the 'Value' field, treating it as a simple task in your daily routine. Once '500g' is entered in the field, take a moment to appreciate the straightforwardness of the process, as the system acknowledges your input. Finally, to solidify your creation, click the 'Save' button, and watch as a 'Successful creation' message gracefully appears at the top of the page, celebrating your achievement."
