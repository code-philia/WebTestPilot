description: To begin your journey through the system's interface, you'll want to head over to the 'Catalog' section and then delve into the 'Attributes & Features' page. Note that upon successful navigation, the 'Attributes & Features' page should appear without any glitches or delays. Now, for the next step, ensure you locate and click the 'Add new value' button situated in the upper right corner of your screen. A new page will emerge, presenting you with a form designed specifically for crafting a new value—this is where the magic happens! From the 'Attribute group' drop-down menu, make sure to pick 'Weight' as your selection; it’s crucial for categorizing the correct type of data. Once 'Weight' is highlighted within the drop-down list, you’ll know you’ve got the right attribute group in place. Next up, it’s time to input a precise value, like '500g', directly into the 'Value' field provided on the form. Just to confirm, the text '500g' should now be visible inside the 'Value' 
  field, indicating that your entry was successful. After verifying everything looks good, proceed by clicking the 'Save' button with confidence. If all goes well, a 'Successful creation' message will pop up at the top of the page, signaling that your new value has been added to the system.
