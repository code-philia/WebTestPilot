description: To begin, you'll want to interact with the interface by clicking the 'Catalog' menu. Next, observe how the Catalog submenu expands, revealing additional options. For detailed instructions, proceed to click the 'Brands & Suppliers' submenu, which will guide you to the next step. Imagine yourself navigating through a digital labyrinth; upon reaching the 'Brands & Suppliers' page, it's like finding a hidden treasure. Now, switch your focus to the 'Suppliers' tab, where the page magically transforms into a list of suppliers. If you encounter any issues, remember that clicking the 'Add new' button should lead to a fresh page dedicated to crafting a new supplier entry. Let's say you're filling out an application form; enter 'Shoes supplier' into the 'Name' field, ensuring the supplier's identity is captured accurately. With the contact details section, input Phone '090-1234-5678', Address 'Nishi-Shinjuku 1-25-1', and City 'Tokyo', making sure each piece of information fits 
  snugly into its designated slot. When selecting the Country, choose 'Japan' from the list, as if picking the right ingredient for a recipe. The State 'Tokyo' should appear in the dropdown, dynamically loaded according to your previous selection—verify this step carefully. To activate the supplier, check the 'Enabled' radio button for 'Yes', effectively turning on the supplier's status. Finally, press the 'Save' button, and voila! A 'Successful creation' message pops up, confirming your task has been completed without a hitch.
