Next, follow these instructions carefully: expand the Catalog submenu by clicking it, ensuring it opens properly. For those seeking detailed technical guidance, note that selecting the 'Brands & Suppliers' submenu will lead you to the corresponding page. Imagine a scene where the 'Brands & Suppliers' page magically appears before your eyes after you've clicked the right submenu. Now, proceed to the 'Suppliers' tab; doing so will seamlessly switch the page to display the suppliers list. If you're ever stuck on how to create a new supplier, just remember to click the 'Add new' button, which will reveal a fresh page dedicated to this task. Let’s say you enter 'Shoes supplier' into the 'Name' field; this action marks the successful entry of the supplier's name. In case you encounter issues with contact details, entering the Phone number '090-1234-5678'
  should resolve any phone-related data entry problems. Narrating further, when you type 'Nishi-Shinjuku 1-25-1' into the Address field, the address is captured perfectly within the system. Simply put, entering 'Tokyo' in the City field completes another step in the process effortlessly. To choose the correct country, click the country dropdown, which will then display all available options for selection. Selecting 'Japan' from the list is straightforward and ensures accuracy in geographical data. When the state dropdown makes its appearance, click it to reveal the states. 'Aichi' becomes the chosen state once selected, aligning with the required location details. For enabling the supplier, check the 'Enabled' radio button next to 'Yes', making the supplier active within the system. Finally, to seal the deal, click the 'Save' button, and behold the 'Successful creation' message that confirms everything went according to plan."
