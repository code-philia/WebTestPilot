description: "To navigate through the system, one should click the \"Customers\" link found within the back-office main menu. Next, you will observe the Customers submenu expanding automatically after your selection. For further action, refer to the instructions: click the \"Customers\" link again, but this time it's in the submenu. Understandably, the goal here is to ensure the customer list page loads without any glitches. Once there, embark on a quest to locate the specific data row for the customer by using their unique email address as your guide. Ah, success! The target row has been spotted accurately among the sea of entries. Now, proceed with caution: click the \"more actions\" button, which is cleverly disguised as a three-dot icon, positioned at the extreme right of the identified row. A dropdown menu emerges, presenting various options including the intriguing \"View\" feature. In this critical juncture, select the \"Delete\" option from the dropdown menu to initiate the removal
  process. Suddenly, a confirmation dialog pops up, demanding your final decision. With a steady hand, click the \"Delete\" button within the dialog box to confirm your choice. Lastly, the system rewards your diligence by displaying a \"Successful deletion\" message, confirming the operation's completion."
