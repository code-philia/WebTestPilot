description: "To begin your journey through the catalog, you'll want to start by clicking the \"Catalog\" menu item, like opening a door to a world of options. Next, follow these instructions carefully: once the Catalog submenu items expand, proceed to click on the \"Attributes & Features\" submenu item. For those seeking technical guidance, note that selecting this option will lead you directly to the Attributes & Features page. Imagine a scene where the page magically transforms, switching to the features list after you click the \"Features\" tab at the top. If you encounter any issues with the page not switching, ensure that JavaScript is enabled in your browser settings. Now, let's add some excitement by clicking \"Add new feature\" located in the top-right corner, which will unveil a new page filled with a form for creating a new feature. In the \"Name\" field, casually jot down an example feature name like \"Season,\" as if you're brainstorming ideas for a novel. Confirm that \"Season\"\
  \ has indeed been entered correctly in the \"Name\" field, just to make sure everything aligns perfectly. Finally, press the \"Save\" button with confidence, and behold—a \"Successful creation\" message will appear, transporting you back to the features list page as if by magic."
