Next up, you're instructed to interact with the size dropdown menu, ensuring it opens up for your selection process. For those needing a quick reference, the size 'M' should be highlighted within the dropdown list once you've made your choice. Understanding why we choose certain sizes can be tricky, but selecting 'M' from the dropdown simplifies the decision-making process. Once upon a time, a customer navigated through the site and had to check the color option, finding Black as their preferred choice. After the color Black is selected, you'll find the \"Add to cart\" button ready for action; give it a click! If a confirmation modal pops up unexpectedly, don't panic—just click \"Continue shopping\" or close it out. With the modal closed, proceed to click the shopping cart icon located at the top of the page. Now, here's where things get technical:
  verify that the product name \"Hummingbird printed t-shirt\", along with the selected color and size, are accurately displayed in the cart. Confirming the details, you'll see the product name, color, and size correctly listed in the cart, just as expected. To remove an item, simply click the \"delete\" link or icon beside the product line item, and watch it vanish like magic. Lastly, ensure the cart is indeed empty by looking for a message stating \"There are no more items in\"."
