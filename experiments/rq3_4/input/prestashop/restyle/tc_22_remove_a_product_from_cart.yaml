description: "To embark on this journey, imagine yourself navigating through an online store, seeking out a particular treasure. In technical terms, ensure the URL directs you to the precise product detail page, confirming its flawless display. Next, follow these instructions: choose the desired size and color for the product with care. Understand that selecting the specifications is crucial for tailoring the item to your needs. Should you encounter any issues, remember that clicking the 'Add to cart' button might resolve them by proceeding with the purchase. Suddenly, a confirmation modal pops up like a ghost in the night; you must decide whether to click 'Continue shopping' or dismiss it. Once the modal fades away like a dream, your path becomes clear again. Now, casually tap the shopping cart icon located at the page's zenith. As the shopping cart page loads, it's time to play detective and verify the product details, including its name and size. If you wish to remove an item, simply
  interact with the 'delete' link or icon beside the product line item, and poof! It vanishes into thin air. Confirm the cart's emptiness by observing the absence of any lingering items. Lastly, a reassuring message will appear, stating, 'There are no more items in your cart,' bringing closure to your digital shopping expedition."
