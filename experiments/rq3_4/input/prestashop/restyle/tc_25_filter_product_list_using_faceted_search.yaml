description: "To embark on your shopping journey, head over to the 'Clothes' section, where a world of fashion awaits you. Next, ensure that the 'Clothes' category page has fully loaded before proceeding; this step is crucial for a smooth experience. Now, follow these instructions carefully: click on the 'Men' sub-category to refine your search. As the page refreshes, it will display an array of products tailored specifically for men's fashion needs. If you encounter any issues with the page not loading correctly, double-check your internet connection and try reloading the page. Moving forward, engage with the 'In stock' checkbox located under the 'Availability' filter to narrow down your options to only those items ready for purchase. With the page reloading once more, prepare yourself for another selection process. Select the 'Discounted' checkbox under the 'Selections' filter to uncover deals that are too good to miss. After the inevitable page reload, focus on the 'Size' filter and check
  the 'M' checkbox to find garments that fit just right. Finally, take a moment to verify the product count text at the top of the results, ensuring accuracy in your search. And there you have it—a neatly summarized product count like 'There is 1 product.' confirms your successful navigation through the site."
