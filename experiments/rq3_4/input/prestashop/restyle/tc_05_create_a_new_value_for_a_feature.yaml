Next, follow these instructions carefully: after clicking 'Catalog', ensure that the submenu items expand properly, revealing further choices for you to select from. For those seeking detailed technical guidance, it's important to note that selecting the 'Attributes & Features' submenu item will direct you to a specialized page dedicated to these elements. Imagine a scene where the Attributes & Features page magically appears before your eyes, ready to unveil its secrets. Now, let’s switch gears and talk about navigating this page; simply click the 'Features' tab located at the top, and watch as the page transforms to display the features list. If you encounter any issues with the features list not appearing, double-check that you've clicked the correct tab and try again. In the top-right corner of your screen, there’s an inviting button
  labeled 'Add new feature value'; give it a click to proceed. A new page emerges, presenting a form that allows you to craft a brand new value, much like a blank canvas awaiting your artistic touch. From the 'Feature' drop-down list, choose 'Season', a selection that will tailor the subsequent steps to seasonal attributes. Confirm that 'Season' is indeed highlighted within the dropdown list, ensuring accuracy in your selections. With a creative flair, type 'Spring/Summer' into the 'Value' field, envisioning the vibrant colors and warm days associated with these seasons. After entering 'Spring/Summer', take a moment to appreciate how this value now resides within the field, ready to be saved. Finally, press the 'Save' button, and behold as a 'Successful creation' message graces the top of the page, celebrating your accomplishment."
