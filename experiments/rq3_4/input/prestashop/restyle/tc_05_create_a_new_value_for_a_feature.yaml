description: "To begin your journey through the system, you'll want to head over to the 'Catalog' section and then delve into 'Attributes & Features'. | Note: Ensure the 'Attributes & Features' page loads without any glitches; it should appear just as expected. | Next up, direct your cursor to the 'Features' tab located at the upper part of the screen and give it a click. | Once clicked, the interface will transition smoothly, revealing the features list for your perusal. | For those looking to expand their options, locate the 'Add new feature value' button nestled in the top-right corner and press it. | What follows is a fresh page, one that greets you with a form ready for inputting a new value. | From the 'Feature' drop-down menu, make your selection wisely by choosing 'Season'. | Confirm your choice by observing 'Season' highlighted within the drop-down list, indicating it's been selected successfully. | Now comes the creative part: type a specific value, say 'Spring/Summer', into the
  'Value' field provided. | With 'Spring/Summer' now occupying the 'Value' field, double-check its presence to ensure accuracy. | Ready to finalize? Simply tap the 'Save' button and watch as the system processes your request. | If all goes well, a 'Successful creation' message will pop up at the top of the page, signaling the completion of your task."
