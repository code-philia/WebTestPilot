Next, you will observe the Customers submenu expanding before your eyes; proceed with clicking the "Customers" link found therein. For technical reference, ensure that upon clicking, the system displays the customer list page accurately without any loading issues. If you encounter difficulties, consider troubleshooting by verifying network connectivity and browser compatibility before proceeding. Once the page loads successfully, embark on a journey by clicking the "Add new" button, which will unveil a new page dedicated to crafting a fresh customer profile. In a casual tone, just pick a "Social title" like "Mr." because everyone needs a title these days! Technically speaking, the selection of the "Mr." option should trigger a successful state change in the dropdown menu. Let’s dive into the narrative where you enter the customer's "First 
  name" and "Last name", painting a vivid picture of who they are through mere keystrokes. Simply put, the customer's name now resides within the designated fields, awaiting further details. Moving along, input the customer's "Email address" into the provided space, ensuring it’s a valid entry. With a focus on security, proceed to enter the customer's "Password", setting the foundation for their account's protection. When selecting the customer's "Birthday", remember to choose the year and month carefully, as accuracy is key. Finally, click the "Save" button, and voila! A "Successful creation" message crowns the top of the page, celebrating the birth of a new customer record.
