description: To begin your journey through the customer management system, you'll want to start by clicking the "Customers" link. Next up, you should observe that the Customers submenu expands, revealing further options. Now, proceed with clicking the "Customers" link found within the submenu, as instructed in our user guide. Once this action is completed, the customer list page should appear before your eyes, confirming everything is on track. For the next step, you're required to click the "Add new" button, which will take you to a fresh page dedicated to crafting a new customer profile. Imagine selecting a "Social title" like "Mr."—this is where you make that choice. Confirming your selection, the "Mr." option is indeed chosen without any issues. Let's move forward by entering "Jones" into the First Name field, making sure it's accurately captured. Following suit, type "Jonathan" into the Last Name field, ensuring the surname is also recorded properly. When it comes to the 
  customer's contact details, input their "Email address" as test@test.com, keeping the format correct. Don't forget to enter the customer's birth year as 2003, filling out all necessary personal information. As we continue, set the customer's birth month to 1, completing another piece of the puzzle. Lastly, input the customer's birth day as 1, finalizing the date of birth section. To wrap things up, click the "Save" button, sealing all the data you've just entered. If everything has gone smoothly, a "Successful creation" message will pop up at the top of the page, signaling your success.
