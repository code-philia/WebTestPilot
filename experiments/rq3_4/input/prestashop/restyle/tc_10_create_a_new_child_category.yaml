description: "To begin your journey through the back-office menu, let's start by clicking \"Catalog\"; it's like opening a treasure chest full of options. Next, follow these instructions carefully: click \"Categories\" to proceed further into the system's organizational structure. For those seeking technical guidance, the next step involves interacting with the \"Add new category\" button, which triggers a new interface for category creation. Imagine a blank canvas appearing before you—a new page for crafting a fresh category is now visible. Now, let your creativity flow as you type the sub-category name, say \"Sports shoes,\" into the designated \"Name\" field, bringing your vision to life. Once \"Sports shoes\" has been successfully entered, it's time to expand your horizons by clicking the \"Expand\" button within the \"Parent Category\" section. With the category tree now fully expanded, you'll find yourself navigating through various options until you select \"Shoes\" as the parent
  category, linking everything together seamlessly. PrestaShop, ever the clever platform, recognizes your intention to establish a sub-category under \"Shoes.\" To add depth to your creation, enter a vivid description in the \"Description\" area, allowing the rich text editor to capture every detail. As you move forward, uploading a \"Category cover image\" becomes the next task, transforming your category with a visual identity. After the upload, you'll see the image filename proudly displayed in the designated area, confirming its presence. To ensure easy access, enter a custom URL such as \"sports-shoes\" in the \"Friendly URL\" field, making navigation a breeze. With \"sports-shoes\" now successfully entered, all that remains is to click the \"Save\" button, culminating in a \"Successful creation\" message crowning your efforts at the top of the page."
