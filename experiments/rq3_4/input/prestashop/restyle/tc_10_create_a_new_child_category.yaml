Next, follow these instructions carefully: after \"Catalog\", locate and select \"Categories\". For those seeking a technical guide, the next step involves interacting with the \"Add new category\" button, which triggers a new interface. Imagine a blank canvas appearing before you—a new page for crafting a category is now ready for your input. Now, let’s dive into the specifics: type \"Sports shoes\" into the \"Name\" field, ensuring clarity and precision in your entry. Once \"Sports shoes\" graces the \"Name\" field, you’ll know you’ve done it right—success is sweet. If you encounter any issues, try clicking the \"Expand\" button within the \"Parent Category\" section to reveal more options. As the category tree unfurls like a blooming flower, your task is to choose \"Shoes\" as the parent category. With \"Shoes\" now securely
  in place as the parent, you’re one step closer to completion. To add depth to your creation, fill the \"Description\" area with a vivid narrative about the category. The rich text editor becomes your playground, allowing the description to come alive with every keystroke. When it comes to URLs, keep it simple yet effective: enter \"sports-shoes\" in the \"Friendly URL\" field for easy navigation. After \"sports-shoes\" finds its home in the URL field, everything should be in order. Finally, hit the \"Save\" button and watch as a \"Successful creation\" message pops up, crowning your efforts with a digital cheer."
