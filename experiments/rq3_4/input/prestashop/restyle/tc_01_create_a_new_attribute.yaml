Next, follow these instructions carefully: after clicking 'Catalog', ensure that the submenu items expand properly, revealing further choices for you to select from. For those seeking detailed technical guidance, it's important to note that selecting the 'Attributes & Features' submenu item will direct you to a specific page dedicated to these elements. Imagine a scene where, upon reaching the Attributes & Features page, you find yourself ready to embark on adding a new attribute, simply by clicking the 'Add new attribute' button located in the top-right corner. Now, envision a new page unfolding before you, complete with a form designed specifically for creating a new attribute, awaiting your input. In the 'Name' field, type 'Weight', marking the first step in defining this new attribute clearly. Confirming that 'Weight' has
  been successfully entered into the 'Name' field brings us one step closer to completion, ensuring accuracy in our data entry process. With the customer experience in mind, enter 'Weight' into the 'Public name' field, making sure that what customers see aligns perfectly with our internal designation. Understand that entering 'Weight' in the public name field ensures consistency between what is shown to customers and the internal records, maintaining clarity throughout. Finally, to solidify all your efforts, click the 'Save' button, sealing the deal on your new attribute creation. If everything has gone according to plan, a 'Successful creation' message should appear at the top of the page, signaling that you've been smoothly returned to the attributes list, ready for your next task."
