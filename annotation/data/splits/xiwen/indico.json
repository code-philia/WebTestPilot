Create recurrent booking that starts in the past and ends in the future\r\n2. Cancel one of the past occurrences\r\n3. Create a single booking when the occurrence in step 2 was\r\n4. Edit the recurrent booking so the end date is later in the future\r\n5. A conflict shows up where the cancelled occurrence was, in the past date of the _Booking after changes_ calendar\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nEdit should happen without any conflict.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nTake into account the date this issue was created (21/06/2019) as it's the date this screenshot was taken and it's relevant to understand the result.\r\n![Screenshot from 2019-06-21 17-07-15](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8863238/59932417-66374d80-9447-11e9-9373-e6892cc8ebcd.png)\r\n\r\n",

        "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nThe first entry in the 'Actions' menu in the 'Registration' page is labelled 'Email' while it's used to send email to participants. As far as I can say, even if the context helps, this is a bit weird in English.\r\n\r\nHowever, it's really weird in French (I mainly use this language) where it says \"Adresse \u00e9lectronique\", literally \"email address\" (singular). According to my Italian and Spanish colleagues, the respective translation in those languages are weird too.\r\n\r\nNote that this is not just a purist issue: this weird phrasing makes hard to find the feature.\r\n\r\nI have attached screenshots for those languages (and suggestions below).\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Go to 'Registration'\r\n2. Click on a registration list\r\n3. Select one or more participants\r\n4. Click on 'Actions'\r\n5. See the first entry\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nFrom my understanding and discussion with my colleagues, I would say:\r\n- in English: \"Send email\"\r\n- in French: \"Envoyer un courrier \u00e9lectronique\" (to stay coherent with other usages)\r\n- in Italian: \"Inviare une email\"\r\n- in Spanish: \"Enviar un correo electr\u00f3nico\"\r\n\r\nOther entries in the 'Action' menu have similar structure.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\nEnglish:\r\n![en](https://github.com/indico/indico/assets/4348913/ac3537d3-22cb-4e99-8e25-57786cce8cf2)\r\n\r\nFrench:\r\n![fr](https://github.com/indico/indico/assets/4348913/75d2e99d-0303-45e7-b38e-c0a84cd660b5)\r\n\r\nItalian:\r\n![it](https://github.com/indico/indico/assets/4348913/0ca706d7-3443-4a0b-adad-04945fb722f9)\r\n\r\nSpanish:\r\n![es](https://github.com/indico/indico/assets/4348913/11c6943b-ca4d-4cb1-a1a2-e2d6380af03c)\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nI don't know much about translations but AFAIK this entry use the \"Email\" message which is used in several files. Maybe we need to differentiate the email address and the action of sending an email.\r\n\r\nNote that there is a \"Send emails\" message which is almost what we need.",

It could also use some UX improvements as well.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\nScenario A:\r\n\r\n1. Go to any page which has a time zone selector\r\n2. Focus the timezone button using a keyboard\r\n3. Open the timezone popup by pressing Enter/Return or Spacebar\r\n4. Try to navigate into the timezone popup\r\n5. Observe that navigation \"skips\" the timezone popup\r\n\r\nScenario B:\r\n\r\n1. Click at the top of the timezone popup so that further keyboard navigation will start from the top of the popup\r\n2. Focus the radios\r\n3. Select the \"Specify a timezone\" radio\r\n4. Observe that the focus is automatically moved to the select list below\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nWhen the popup is expanded, the keyboard focus should move to the popup *when the user presses Tab key* (not automatically).\r\n\r\nWhen the \"Specify a timezone\" radio is selected, focus should *not* automatically move to the select list.\r\n\r\nThere are also several issues with the semantics of the markup which I will address in a patch for this issue.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n- https://talk.getindico.io/t/keyboard-navigation-session-bar-timezone-picker/3197/3\r\n- https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/keyboard.html",

The paper sizes are only A0, A1, A2, A3, A5 and letter (I would also suggest putting the \ndefault as A4, rather than A0) so that it corresponds to the templates that are on there from the older version.\n\nWould it be possible to work on this so that the posters come out with  the correct size, dimensions as before?\n\nOtherwise, so far, it seems quite pleasant to work with. Thank you.\n\nKind regards,\n\nMichelle.\n```\n",

        "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nWhen placing a label (free text) in a registration form it is only shown at the registration itself, but when I want to modify the registration, I do not see the label. Likely this bug has appeared in 2.1.x, because I am almost certain that in 2.0.x it worked.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Create an event and a registration form\r\n2. Add a \"free text\" aka label field to it \r\n3. Open up the registration and register (you will see that your label is there)\r\n4. Modify the registration afterwards (no label there) \r\n\r\nI also checked it on the sandbox.getindico.io\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nI expect the label to be also present when being in modification mode. The whole point of it is to allow resubmitting information as a registrant, therefore I do not only need the modifiable fields but also the labels that have some reason to be there (e.g. stating \"please only choose type x, when you are under 18...) \r\n\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n<img width=\"997\" alt=\"screenshot 2018-12-04 at 18 30 30\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7829685/49460985-f20ec280-f7f2-11e8-968d-d355d822ad73.png\">\r\n<img width=\"800\" alt=\"screenshot 2018-12-04 at 18 30 59\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7829685/49460987-f2a75900-f7f2-11e8-9fa2-b95fca118b44.png\">\r\n\r\n",

Nevertheless, I can read their names in some version of the event, e.g. using the \"Indico style\" theme.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nThe event is the following: https://agenda.infn.it/event/18661/\r\nThe issue appears in the following ways:\r\n- changing the theme of the event (\"Change theme\" button in the top-left corner), e.g. to the \"Indico style\" (https://agenda.infn.it/event/18661/timetable/?view=standard);\r\n- in the page https://agenda.infn.it/event/18661/timetable/?print=1&view=standard which appears as a result searching on Google for the event;\r\n- in the timetable page when the manager of the event chooses some of the themes for it, like the \"Indico style\".\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe names of the pending people should not appear anywhere.\r\n",

        "body": "In the \"Select a category\" dialog (e.g. \"Create meeting\" from the menu -> press \"Choose category\" button) the popup text, which appears when a mouse pointer is hovered over the number of categories and events on the right hand side of each row in the dialog, is **partially translated**. The text is \"{0} categories | {0} events\" with numbers inserted instead of \"{0}\" and single or plural form of the word \"category\"/\"event\" used.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the \"{0} events\" part of that string is properly translated, while the \"{0} categories\" always stays in English.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Go to \"Create meeting\" in the main menu\r\n2. Click on \"Choose category\" button\r\n3. Hover mouse pointer over the numbers on the right hand side of any row in the dialog\r\n4. See mixed-language text in the popup (see the screenshot for reference)\r\n\r\nOr just search for `\"{0} categories\"` on Transifex and see that it is missing.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe text of the popup should be fully translated.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nGerman translation is used because on Transifex it is 100% translated, so no English words should be present (in theory)\r\n![2024-12-01_21-33-52](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a75c2da9-ed9c-4b33-8d3a-22f4dc606486)\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n I assume that the code is located here: [indico/web/client/js/jquery/widgets/categorynavigator.js](https://github.com/indico/indico/blob/4fa81c297f4c08d5b842e420a26125627c5bc4cd/indico/web/client/js/jquery/widgets/categorynavigator.js#L300). So the issue might be with `indico/web/client/js/jquery/widgets/categorynavigator.js` missing from Transifex. The \"{0} events\" substring is present in Transifex as it appears also in `indico/modules/categories/client/js/display.js`, but the \"{0} categories\" substring seems to be unique to `categorynavigator.js`.",
