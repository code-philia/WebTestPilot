When I create an invoice out of the tracked task the time-log-billable-flag for TWIG is set to false while it's originally not touched at all. In the task-section so it's  set to true (as it has to be).\n\nTo solve this, I have to change the flag(s) manually to not billable, save the task, and then set it back to billable (and save it again), to set the twig-flag correctly.\n\nThe hours, however, seem to be correct in the invoice.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\nGood question, I cannot reproduce the issue on will.\n\n### Expected Behavior\nThe flag should always fit to the set flag in the task.\n\n\n### Screenshots\n\n<img width=\"2545\" height=\"437\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd15c5a9-f87b-4943-8250-18824d1a8328\" />\nThis is the untouched result of creating an invoice out of 2 billable task-logs.\n\n<img width=\"2545\" height=\"437\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95e7463d-c67e-4afb-8a88-971f36987872\" />\nThis is after I set one of the billable-checkboxes to not billable and back. I left the other one on billable. (Sorry, I marked the wrong checkbox red.)\n\n### Logs\nSeems there are no laravel-log-entries of creating this invoice-pdf.",

Create a second company (there must be at least two accounts)\n2. Create a new client for this company\n3. Go to its customer portal and to the statements tab\n\n### Expected Behavior\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen. -->\nThe details of the company to which the client belongs and the details of the client visiting the portal should be given.\n\n## Additional context\n<!-- Add any other context about the problem here. -->\nAfter the first invoice for this client has been issued, the data starts to be displayed correctly. In theory, the client should only see the portal after receiving the first bill, but this is nevertheless a data leak from another account and should be fixed.\n\n### Screenshots\n<!-- If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem. -->\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e965ec35-0e16-4b0b-92b8-d8ca37b00f5b)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bfb62d61-0625-46dc-b69d-9a7b28ea3bb6)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2079dbb-6bd5-4023-911d-41fec2ad0de4)\n\n### Logs\n<!-- Please check the log files (storage/logs/) and provide redacted output -->\n```\n\n```",

(not tried out yet/no account)\n- [X] Have you searched existing issues?\n- [ ] Have you reported this to Slack/forum before posting?\n- [X] Have you inspected the logs in storage/logs/laravel.log for any errors? -> nothing found\n\n## Describe the bug\nWhen a user orders a product (recurring monthly or single payment) through one of my payment links, I instantly get an email about a completed payment, when in fact the user didn't even see my BTCPay payment gateway.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n* setup BTCPay as only payment method\n* create a payment link with one product (a) for 0,10 EUR\n* let user use the payment link, they login and get this form:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00bfaaba-2b1c-4929-bffe-51276ec167ac)\n\nno payment method can be selected.\n\n### Expected Behavior\nShow the BTCPay payment method and send the user through the payment process for the first invoice for recurring invoices and keep the invoice as unpaid as long as that hadn't happend. Subsequent invoices should be handled the same way.\n\n## Additional context\nCurrently running a testinstance, so anything can be tried out on request.\n\n### Screenshots\n<!-- If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem. -->\n\n### Logs\n<!-- Please check the log files (storage/logs/) and provide redacted output -->\n```\n\n```",

When i remove $tax_info then this placeholder is also not shown. But i need $tax_info.\r\n\r\nWhen i search on [github](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Ainvoiceninja%2Finvoiceninja+small_company_info&type=code) then it seems to have to do with the definition of “small company” where no taxes are applied. But i never changed my company info to that.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"889\" alt=\"Bildschirmfoto 2025-01-20 um 09 20 18\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52e216c2-a344-4d28-bbe2-6b1cdb8108a6\" />\r\n\r\nCan someone tell me where i can define that i am no small company? Because i can not find it.\r\n\r\nThank you, best regards, Andreas</div>",

This issue replicates on both demo environments.\r\n- Have you searched existing issues?\r\n   - > Yes, could not find any others mentioning this.\r\n- Have you inspected the logs in storage/logs/laravel.log for any errors?\r\n   - > Yes, no errors are present there.\r\n\r\n## Describe the bug\r\nUsing the Business design for all document types, there is bizarre line spacing for my company contact details, my company address, and the payee's details on a Purchase Order.\r\n\r\nHere is a screenshot of my Quote with great line spacing:\r\n![PO_Spacing_Issue1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08972eaf-88ba-4e41-92fc-cc780ad1ac76)\r\n\r\nNow here is the Invoice, again with great line spacing:\r\n![PO_Spacing_Issue2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a858f116-951b-4149-93a6-b1f9d47844b5)\r\n \r\nAnd finally, where I believe there to be an issue, here is the Purchase Order with ugly line spacing:\r\n![PO_Spacing_Issue3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b952d7d4-6b8d-4c0e-b1eb-bd5ed6db5dbf)\r\n - Notice 3 unexpected line spaces between company name and company website\r\n - There is also 2 unexpected line spaces between company address line-1 and company address city/state/zip.\r\n - The payee information is very far indented away to the right of `PO issued to:` text, instead of directly below as seen in the Quote and Invoice templates. This creates a large block of oddly useless space under here.\r\n - This all creates a bunch of awkward whitespace under the logo, under the address, etc. This image is 50px taller than the other two while capturing the same information due to this spacing issue.\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\nIt's important to note I have not modified this application or changed/added/removed any code of any kind from anywhere. I started using the application recently, I added my logo, all my company details, some clients and vendors, and removed a few built-in variable fields here and there. In the case of the PO, I only removed the 'Number' field from the default set in Settings > Invoice Design > Purchase Order fields.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nI'd expect the header for the Purchase Order and the static information held there to certainly look identical to headers in the Quote & Invoice, without the unnecessary line spacing I show here.\r\n\r\nI think that should detail this enough. This is obviously some kinda bug, right? I believe from what I've seen around the InvoiceNinja ecosystem that Purchase Orders are one of newer big features. I really like the Business design and would prefer to keep it to retain a consistent brand across my customer & vendor-facing documents.\r\n\r\nThanks, let me know!</div>",

This leads in some cases to the situation that the total taxes at the bottom of the invoice are not displayed correctly.\r\n\r\nWe are using the Calculate Taxes option where we have a standard tax_rate of 20% and a reduced tax_rate of 10%. We also defined a custom tax_rate of 13% (where I have to choose “override tax” on the create invoice page to use it).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Example to reproduce:\r\n\r\nCreate new invoice with 4 line items:\r\n\r\n```\r\nItem    |   Tax rate           |   Cost\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\nItem 1  |   Override -> 13%    | -1234.0\r\nItem 2  |   Tax Exempt         |     0.0\r\nItem 3  |   Services           |     0.0\r\nItem 4  |   Services           |   123.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThen the totals at the bottom look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nNet              -1.111,00 €\r\nUSt 13%          -160,42 €\r\n20%               24,60 €\r\nTotal            -1.246,82 €\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n==> The tax_name is not present for the 20% taxes (it should be \"USt 20%\").\r\n### Screenshot:\r\n![example_invoice_no_tax_name](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89168add-3b1e-462a-84a7-1d807447e8e6)\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I put the Item with \"Tax Exempt\" at the bottom of the line_items list, then the total tax at the bottom is displayed correctly (\"Ust 20%\"). When i move it up again the tax name disappears.\r\nAlso by creating an invoice with only positive amounts I wasn't able to reproduce this behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\n(When I create a similar invoice like the one above over the API then sometimes the line with the 20% tax at the bottom is missing completely.)\r\n\r\n\r\nBy querying the invoice over the API I can see that there is no tax_name present for all the line_items that come after the \"tax exempt\" one with 0.0 cost.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother thing I just found out: In the example above, when I change the two line items with cost 0.0 to something positive, then I have two tax lines at the bottom, one with \"20%\" and another with \"USt 20%\".\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I can add up the listed expenses and it comes up to the higher (correct) amount. I have correlated this to two recurring expenses I have setup. Each time an automated recuring expense triggers, the expense exchange rate is a 0 (zero) where all my other manually entered expenses appear as an exchange rate of 1. -This was discovered running an expense report. My currency is USD and I do not deal with any other currency or exchange rates. When I look at the automated expense entries in the app…the currency settings between the automated expenses and my manually entered expenses are identical. The difference in the Total Expense dollar amount in the profit and loss report, is the exact amount of these automated recuring expenses that show a 0 (zero) for the Expense Exchange Rate. \r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\nCreate recuring expense. I had just two and they have been in place since April 2024. All entries created by this automated process where affected.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nUse the default exchange rate settings defined. I do not use any exchange rates or conversions and when manually entering expenses I do not make any related changes. I would expect recurring expenses to follow the same rules. \r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\nThe \"quick\" fix was opening each of these automated expense entries in the app (react ui), making no changes, and just clicking save. This resulted in each affected entries Expense Exchange Rate to change to a 1. This was verified by running another expense report as well as another profit and loss report which now shows the correct Total Expense dollar amount. I have deleted recuring expenses for now.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\nScreen snip from expense report showing one manual entry with a \"1\" and one automated recurring expense entry which is created with a \"0\". \r\n![image](https://github.com/invoiceninja/invoiceninja/assets/866696/ee5895ac-c4c7-4e39-a7c1-15d82994d4e7)\r\n\r\n",

Creating an expense one can set the switch 'amount incl. taxes'. If this switch is set to on, in the report the Amount will be shown including taxes and the 'net amount'-amount without taxes. BUT if the switch is set to off, the amount-columns are swapped. So within the same (!) exported report the amount of the expense is set to excluding taxes and the 'net amount' which always should be without taxes (\"Netto-Betrag\" in German, which means the amount without taxes or other includes) shows the amount including the tax(es). So depending on how the 'tax including'-switch is set the columns show the right or wrong amount in an report-CSV-file.\r\n\r\nHowever the Flutter-desktop-app sorts the amounts correctly on the expense-overview.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n![Bildschirmfoto vom 2024-07-01 11-17-42](https://github.com/invoiceninja/invoiceninja/assets/140073251/1edf80a1-4c24-4ca1-9ff1-b006681139cd)\r\n",

You can set if by default a new expense sets the \"Inclusive Taxes\" toogle to on or off. This setting is respected when creating a new expense on the Expenses page but not if a new expense is created via the Transactions page.\r\n\r\nThis can lead to confusion.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the amount that is set in the new expense is negative. It would be nice if it could be absolute.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nRespecting the configured default setting and transferring the amount from the transaction to the new expense as a positive number.",

But if you select one and you want to click on apply, the following error message arrives. In the react-app the draft is not selectable. I guess, this is a bug in flutter-web-app.\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\nCreate an invoice-draft, create a non-applied payment, and after saving the payment try to apply it to an invoice.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nI guess the draft should not be shown as an apply-selector.\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\nNope.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n![Bildschirmfoto vom 2024-02-02 10-37-58](https://github.com/invoiceninja/invoiceninja/assets/140073251/3290aeb7-5c77-4b98-b7ef-58abdcc9f6ff)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Logs\r\nSorry, no log-files.\r\n```\r\n\r\n```",

The page refreshed and is now blank. I rebooted the VM, still blank. I switch from Firefox to Chromium, still blank. \r\n\r\nTo return to a functional state, I invoked 'UPDATE accounts SET set_react_as_default_ap = 0;' in the database. Now it is showing the flutter interface again. I tried the react interface again and it was blank.

Yes\r\n- Have you searched existing issues? Yes\r\n- Have you reported this to Slack/forum before posting? Yes, [previously reported on the forum](https://forum.invoiceninja.com/t/cosmetic-defects-in-pdf-view-when-unit-cost-values-are-negative/12660/3)\r\n- Have you inspected the logs in storage/logs/laravel.log for any errors? Yes, nothing useful found\r\n\r\n## Describe the bug\r\nThe negative figures in unit cost column are still displayed incorrectly & inconsistently:\r\n- If the value is a whole negative number, the .00 decimal part is stripped. If it's not a whole negative number, the display is correct.\r\n- The minus sign is placed behind the dollar sign, which is inconsistent with the display elsewhere in the app\r\n\r\n### Steps To Reproduce\r\n1. Create a product with a negative unit cost value.\r\n2. Create an invoice with that product and witness the result.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nThe .00 part should not be obliterated. The minus sign should be placed before the dollar sign. Notice that the correct behaviour in the line total column.\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\nA previous fix is already implemented in commit 681fc47a68d67c467d75a428d99fd9a5c5b3c9fb\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11343760/222041027-780d72de-f4ae-4312-b9be-d5c190b70dbc.png)\r\n\r\n### Logs\r\nN/A",

YES\r\n\r\n## Describe the bug\r\nOn a brand new install, I've added 2 new Clients. Afterwards, going to Invoices or Quotes menu, in the \"Client\" dropdown the 2 new clients appear, however when attempting to select either one of them, the the dropdown closes and \"Please select a client\" message appears underneath the input in red, with the input box being empty. Interestingly, it does allow to properly select a client in the \"New task\" section. Also clicking on a client \"view statement\" button on a client results in \"/api/v1/client_statement? 500 response\" in the console, in addition getting a 500 response when going into \"settings\" -> \"invoice design\" throws https://client.testcompany.com/api/v1/preview? 500 error. I've tried Chrome, Firefox, Opera, as well as the Phone app. They all fail the same way. \r\n\r\nThis is an error that appears in browser console when attempting to generate an invoice:\r\n\r\nUncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'w')\r\n    at Object.xl (main.foss.dart.js?v=5.5.55:74624:22)\r\n    at Object.dW (main.foss.dart.js?v=5.5.55:34629:5)\r\n    at main.foss.dart.js?v=5.5.55:38393:30\r\n    at dXV.a (main.foss.dart.js?v=5.5.55:5890:62)\r\n    at dXV.$2 (main.foss.dart.js?v=5.5.55:88459:14)\r\n    at Object.O (main.foss.dart.js?v=5.5.55:5876:10)\r\n    at Object.SO (main.foss.dart.js?v=5.5.55:38466:10)\r\n    at Object.dM (main.foss.dart.js?v=5.5.55:37367:37)\r\n    at axp.b2q (main.foss.dart.js?v=5.5.55:225822:3)\r\n",

Not showing 10% + $0.00 then suddenly being adjusted to 2.2% (the correct fee) on the next page.\r\n\r\nIt also makes no sense to have \"+ $0.00\" since square doesn't charge a fixed fee and I only have a percentage entered for the gateway  and no fixed fees.

It's possible to see that there is page activity happening from the browser tab showing the spinning wheel but most people don't notice this and wondering whats happening. There needs to be some sort of loading animation presented to the user on the page or the approve button so the client knows something is processing.\r\n\r\n",

        "body": "**What version of Invoice Ninja are you running? ie v4.5.25 / v5.0.30**\r\nv5.1.42\r\n**What environment are you running?**\r\nSelf-hosted Git install\r\n\r\n**Have you checked log files (storage/logs/) Please provide redacted output**\r\n\r\nThere are no logs from this activity or otherwise from today.\r\n\r\n**Have you searched existing issues?**\r\n\r\nYes, I couldn't find an existing report\r\n\r\n**Have you reported this to Slack/forum before posting?**\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\nA clear and concise description of what the bug is.\r\n\r\nI have manually made a partial payment in the admin area to an existing invoice. In the admin area, the status of the invoice updated to 'Partial' but the status in the client portal now says 'Overdue'. In the invoices table, the status_id is \"3\". The due date on the invoice is ~1month in the future. When submitting the payment, I marked the date as 2 days in the past to reflect the date the client made the payment.\r\n\r\n**Steps To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nCreate an invoice with a partial amount due on the current date.\r\nGo to payments, click \"+\", and select the invoice. Add the partial amount to match the balance due (I tested with bank transfer) and submit.\r\nCheck status in invoices, then check client portal status of the same invoice.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe status in the client portal should reflect the status in admin area \"Partial\".\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nScreens and sql dumps attached\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nI had to import all data manually from an earlier database from v5.0 as the migration reported missing tables. It is possible some erroneous data exists (see dumps) - I can provide a complete db if it helps.\r\n\r\n**(v5) Can you replicate the issue on our demo site? https://demo.invoiceninja.com**\r\n\r\nI don't have time now but will test and update this issue in a few hours.\r\n\r\n##### EDIT 14/04/21 12:35\r\nI have tested in the demo site and I can reproduce the scenario. It seems the payment doesn't/is unable to update the invoice status because having a payment applied has locked it. This behaviour is desirable to prevent changes to the invoice contents but the status of the invoice in the client portal should ideally show as \"partial\" or similar.\r\n\r\nThis is the logic that makes sense to me:\r\n\r\n**\"Overdue\"** status should show if the total of payments affecting the invoice is less than the balance due and the balance due date is less than the present date **OR** if the total of the payments is equal to or greater than the partial balance due but less than the invoice total due and the invoice total due date is less than the present date.\r\n\r\n**\"Partial\"** status should show when the total payments affecting the invoice is equal to or greater than the balance due but less than the total invoice due and the total invoice due date is greater than the present date.\r\n\r\n![admin_area_invoice](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67714557/114698178-b10a0f80-9d16-11eb-8f96-e4384ca7bcd4.png)\r\n![client_area_invoice](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67714557/114698182-b1a2a600-9d16-11eb-8260-279b8a7c12c0.png)\r\n[Downloads.tar.gz](https://github.com/invoiceninja/invoiceninja/files/6310246/Downloads.tar.gz)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

My bank only deals with British Pounds; any payments received are automatically converted by them.\r\n\r\nWhen I create payments in Invoice Ninja, I use the currency converter to record that the payment was converted by my bank.\r\n\r\nThe amount paid is the same as on the invoice, which is the amount in EUR. The amount after conversion is the amount in my bank account.\r\n\r\n**Problem:**\r\nWhen I type in the amount, Invoice Ninja calculates the exchange rate for that amount. The exchange rate field only allows 4 decimal places. It can't calculate the correct value to reach the same number I just typed in.\r\n\r\nThe result is that I'll type in a number like \"902.09\" and Invoice Ninja will change it to \"902.07\" for me, which does not match the amount that I actually received.\r\n\r\n**Proposed solution:**\r\nIncrease the exchange rate field to allow 5 decimal places. This will allow every possible value to be represented.",

If # is the first character used in the field. It omits the symbol, in the Statement and Invoice screen. It also gives that address line an non-regular font size (bigger than the other address lines).\r\n\r\nThe work around is the place it at the back of the first address line, or place some other part of the address in front of the #.",

I'm not sure is it just me or what, does anyone here aware it's super buggy and almost unusable?\r\n\r\nI try create Template and Snippet. Set the styling, Cell Width, Font Size, Cell BG colour, once satisfied, Save It.\r\n\r\nWhen try to use the Snippet at Proposal creation, the nightmare happen. All of the Styles in Snippet GONE!\r\n\r\nI tried with Template and Snippet, both have same problem, nicely design and styled and in the end, it cant be use because of the styling is totally out.\r\n\r\nAlso, the image upload, by default is it preset to image dimension larger than 400px not allow upload?\r\n\r\nI try upload image, it only allow me to upload small images below 400px. I try upload images with dimension 100px, 200px, 300px, 400px and 500px.\r\n\r\nImages with width 100px to 300px can be upload without problem. But image of 400px and 500px or anything image over this size, the upload never show the thumbnail and upload never success.\r\n\r\nI wonder anyone else having the problem that I have?

For example, I have a fee setup on credit card transactions of $0.30 + 2.9%.  On a $2000.00 invoice a surcharge line item is added in the amount of $58.30 (this is correct) with an invoice total of ($2000 * 1.029) + .30 = $2058.30.  The issue is that the Pay Now button shows \"Credit Card - $59.99 Fee\" which is not correct.   If you take ($2058.30 * .029) + .30 you get $59.9907 (or $59.99) which is what we are seeing in the Pay Now button.\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2018-05-18 at 11 49 47 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2146963/40244726-a35b7a2e-5a91-11e8-8c0c-e7e8df3663e2.png)\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2018-05-18 at 11 39 31 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2146963/40244731-a840d5d4-5a91-11e8-8d24-ed97854f0344.png)\r\n",

In this case the fields are set to the following:\r\n\r\nOrganization:\r\n    - Name: `is empty`\r\n\r\nContacts:\r\n    - First Name: `Vaya Adventures`\r\n    - Last Name: `is empty`\r\n\r\nI'm going to assume that the json tries to return the Organization name first then the customer but in this case since there is no organization name it returns null? May I suggest perhaps we display nothing rather than `null`? I'm open to other input.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Update\r\n\r\nSeems after updating the organization name and removing the contacts first name it displays properly now. Maybe I'll put in a pull request for this..",

This would explain why the 2 invoices were already sent.\r\n\r\nI hope this explanation is clear enough. My first instinct was to delete the wrong invoices and send apologizing messages to my customers so I cannot accurately recall all steps I have taken. I believe the above is the gist of it.\r\n\r\n![screenshot from 2017-04-27 10-58-45](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17289887/25476356/37ca893a-2b3a-11e7-8440-eca1429d5658.png)\r\n![screenshot from 2017-04-27 10-58-46](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17289887/25476358/37cc202e-2b3a-11e7-80a5-b30eaf3848a3.png)\r\n",
