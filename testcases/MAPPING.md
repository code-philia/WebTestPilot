# bookstack

## 1 Hierarchical content organization model

### 1.1 Knowledge content is organized into a four-tier system: Shelves, Books, Chapters, and Pages; users can create Shelves, Books, Chapters, and Pages.

#### 1.1.1 Creating a Book

<video controls="" loop="" muted="" preload="none" src="https://docs.pikapods.com/tutorials/documentation/bookstack-1-basics/1-create-book.mp4" poster="https://docs.pikapods.com/tutorials/documentation/bookstack-1-basics/1-create-book.webp" style="box-sizing: border-box; width: 736px; height: auto; color: rgb(92, 89, 98); font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, blinkmacsystemfont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, arial, sans-serif, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;"></video>



Adding and editing books in BookStack is straightforward. You can include content, tables, images, and links. Here’s how to create a book:

1. In the upper right corner, click on **books**.
2. Click **create a new book** under the actions on the right side of your screen.
3. Provide a **name and description** for the new book.
4. Add a **cover image** (size: 440x250 px) by clicking **select image**.
5. Optionally, include **tags** for improved categorization.
6. Click **save book**.

#### 1.1.2 Creating a Chapter

<video controls="" loop="" muted="" preload="none" src="https://docs.pikapods.com/tutorials/documentation/bookstack-1-basics/2-create-chapter.mp4" poster="https://docs.pikapods.com/tutorials/documentation/bookstack-1-basics/2-create-chapter.webp" style="box-sizing: border-box; width: 736px; height: auto; color: rgb(92, 89, 98); font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, blinkmacsystemfont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, arial, sans-serif, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;"></video>



Books can contain multiple chapters, which can be added and edited as needed. Here’s how to create a chapter:

1. Click on **new chapter** on the right side of your screen.
2. Write a **title and description** for the chapter.
3. Optionally, include **tags**.
4. Click **save chapter**.

#### 1.1.3 Creating a Page

<video controls="" loop="" muted="" preload="none" src="https://docs.pikapods.com/tutorials/documentation/bookstack-1-basics/3-create-page.mp4" poster="https://docs.pikapods.com/tutorials/documentation/bookstack-1-basics/3-create-page.webp" style="box-sizing: border-box; width: 736px; height: auto; color: rgb(92, 89, 98); font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, blinkmacsystemfont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, arial, sans-serif, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;"></video>



Pages can belong to books or chapters and accommodate varying lengths of content. Here’s how to create a page:

1. Click on **new page** on the right side of your screen.
2. Add a **page title** above the editing ribbon on your dashboard.
3. Compose your **content** using the editing tools on the ribbon.
4. Click **save page** at the top right above the editing ribbon.

#### 1.1.4 Creating a Shelf

<video controls="" loop="" muted="" preload="none" src="https://docs.pikapods.com/tutorials/documentation/bookstack-1-basics/4-create-shelf.mp4" poster="https://docs.pikapods.com/tutorials/documentation/bookstack-1-basics/4-create-shelf.webp" style="box-sizing: border-box; width: 736px; height: auto; color: rgb(92, 89, 98); font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, blinkmacsystemfont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, arial, sans-serif, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;"></video>



Shelves help you organize and categorize your books or documents. They are useful for managing content by departments, categories, industries, or disciplines. Here’s how to create a shelf:

1. Click on the **shelves** button in the upper menu.
2. Under **actions** on the right, click **new shelf**.
3. Provide a **name and description** for the shelf.
4. **Select** the books you want on this shelf by clicking the **plus** sign next to their names.
5. Optionally, add a **cover image** that represents the shelf.
6. Include **tags** for easy navigation (optional).
7. Click **save shelf** at the bottom of the screen.

### 1.2  Chapters and Pages support movement.

Pages and chapters can be moved directly to a new chapter or book. To move a chapter or page in this way, go to a page or chapter and select ‘Move’ in the actions list:

![Page Move Action](https://www.bookstackapp.com/images/docs/user/page-move.png)

Clicking the ‘Move’ action will take you to a screen where you can select a new location for your chapter or page. Here you can search for a particular book or chapter using the search bar at the top of the selection screen. Once you select a new parent for your chapter or page press ‘Move Page’ or ‘Move Chapter’ and your chapter or page will be moved to the new chapter or book. If you move a chapter all child pages will remain in that chapter and any related activity will now show up under the new parent book.

### 1.3  Books support sorting.

The ‘Book Sort’ interface allows you to move multiple pages and chapters with ease in a simple drag and drop interface. To sort the content of a Book content, open the Book and find the “Sort” option within the actions list.

![Book Sort](https://www.bookstackapp.com/images/docs/user/book-sort.png)

Initially, just the book you came from will show on the left. You can add extra books into the sort interface by selecting them on the right. Here you can simply drag and drop chapters and pages around and also between different books. Once you have organised your content press ‘Save’ and all included books will be re-organised.

If you’d instead want books sorted automatically, refer to the [Sort Rules](https://www.bookstackapp.com/docs/user/organising-content/#sort-rules) section below.

#### Permissions Required for Sorting

Since content during a sort can be moved to new locations, the results of sorting can alter the applied visibility & permissions of your content. Due to this, moving an item requires quite a few permissions. For sorting changes to apply, the following permissions are needed (considered per sorted item):

- **Edit** permission on item being moved.
- **Edit** permission on the original pre-sort parent.
- If item is moving to a new parent book/chapter:
  - **Edit** permission on new parent.
  - **Create** permission for content type within new parent.
  - **Delete** permission for content type within pre-sort parent.

For example, if I wanted to move page `Page A` from `Book A` to `Book B`, I’d need:

- Edit permissions for: `Page A`, `Book A` and `Book B`
- Create permissions for pages in `Book B`
- Delete permissions for pages in `Book A`

### Sort Rules

Sort rules can be used for automatic sorting of content. These are predefined sorting operations which be assigned to books. They are managed by admin-level users via the “Settings > Sorting” view, and they allow multiple sort actions to be configured which will be performed in order:

![“Edit Sort Rule” view in BookStack, showing the list of configured sort operations and a larger list of draggable available operations.](https://www.bookstackapp.com/images/docs/user/sort-rule-edit.png)

Sort rules can then be used in the following locations:

- As the “Default Book Sort” option in “Settings > Sorting”, which will apply the configured sort to all newly created books thereafter.
- Assigned to a specific book, by the “Auto Sort Option” in the “Sort” view of a book.
- Batch assigned to content, via the [“Assign Sort Rule” command](https://www.bookstackapp.com/docs/admin/commands/#assign-sort-rule).

Once assigned to a book, the sort operation will automatically run on each event which could affect the sort order (page update, chapter creation etc…).

Sort rules can be assigned to book if a user has permission to edit that book, but the creation and modification of sort rules can only be done by users that have permission to manage application settings. This allows admin users to centrally manage the available rules and their behaviour while allowing sort assignment and execution to users with lower level permissions.

#### Sort Rule Operations

Here are details of each of the available sort rule operations:

- **Name - Alphabetical:** Case insensitive basic alphabetical sort using the name.
- **Name - Numeric:** Will attempt to parse a numeric value (24, 24.125), up to one decimal point, from the start of the name and sort on that.
- **Created Date:** Sort by the content’s creation date.
- **Updated Date:** Sort by the content’s updated date.
- **Chapters First/Last:** Move chapters to the start/end of the ordering.

Typically you would only use one or two operations, since most would override the rule prior.

## 2 Multi-functional content editing.

### 2.1BookStack provides a flexible editing environment to meet different user preferences: default WYSIWYG Editor and optional Markdown Editor.

- **(WYSIWYG) Editor**：https://www.bookstackapp.com/docs/user/wysiwyg-editor/

- **Markdown Editor**: https://www.bookstackapp.com/docs/user/markdown-editor/

### 2.2 Both the default WYSIWYG Editor and the optional Markdown Editor support inserting diagrams.

​	https://www.bookstackapp.com/docs/user/diagrams/

## 3 Roles and permissions.

### 3.1 User capabilities are controlled by roles assigned to them and permissions provided to those roles. A user can be assigned multiple roles by an administrator, in which case permissions will stack, and if any role provides a specific capability, the user will possess that capability.

​	https://www.bookstackapp.com/docs/user/roles-and-permissions/

## 4  Advanced search and navigation.

### 4.1 The top search bar provides global search across all content, while contextual search bars within Books and Chapters allow for scope-limited searches.

### 1.4 Merchants can configure brands for their products.

https://docs.prestashop-project.org/v.8-documentation/user-guide/selling/managing-catalog/managing-brands

### 1.5 Merchants can configure supplier information.

https://docs.prestashop-project.org/v.8-documentation/user-guide/selling/managing-catalog/managing-suppliers

## 2 Merchants can view all order details, update order information, and process returns and refunds.

###  2.1 Merchants can update order information.

**All the text descriptions below are taken from this overall URL page:https://docs.prestashop-project.org/v.8-documentation/user-guide/selling/managing-orders/order-page-management/editing-order**

**Of course, We only selected the important functions.**

#### 2.1.1 Merchants can update order status.

There are two places on the order page where you can update its status:

- In the **top left-hand corner** of the page, next to the action buttons.
- In the **Status tab**

Select the status you want in the drop-down list and click on the “Update status” button. 

![img](https://docs.prestashop-project.org/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F3898701297-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-legacy-files%2Fo%2Fassets%252F-MCHq1J-FbQwQZ2OB1vQ%252F-MUDJXKnoxq__EXwKDgT%252F-MUDNoeZgxcxiOvp99Ik%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Dd6872c76-fe88-4f52-85ae-654c34b4a5bd&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=5654ba61&sv=2)

You can choose between the following statuses:

Any module impacting the order monitoring might extend this status list.

In order to get a better view of the order's activity, every status change is recorded in the “Status” tab, as well as its author and the date/time of the update.

![img](https://docs.prestashop-project.org/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F3898701297-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-legacy-files%2Fo%2Fassets%252F-MCHq1J-FbQwQZ2OB1vQ%252F-MU8xxNYcm_lasmBCi9z%252F-MU92kI44FhNLAw4-LwG%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D2accba45-6e08-409a-8981-699283f71ea6&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=888db096&sv=2)



It is very important to **update a status only when it has been clearly confirmed**. For example, do not mark an order as “Delivered” when you have only sent the package, use “Shipped” instead. 

📨 For some status updates, an email is sent to the customer. You can resend this email by clicking on the button next to the order status, in the Status tab. If you have edited the order at some point, the customer will receive an updated email.

#### 2.1.2 Add new products to an order.

At the bottom of the product list:

- Click on the "Add a product" button
- Enter the product’s name
- Select the product you want to add 
- Set the quantity 
- Select the invoice on which you want this product to appear and click on the "Add" button

If the invoice has already been sent to the customer, you should not add new products to it. Instead, you should create another invoice: when adding a new product, choose "create a new invoice" in the drop-down list. 

Note that you cannot add more products than available in stock. When you select a product, the number of items in stock appears in the “Available” column.

➡️ To add a product that is already present in the order, click on the “Edit” button and modify the quantity.

#### 2.1.3 Remove products from an order.

**‌**To remove a product from the order, go to the product list and delete the product by clicking on the "Delete" button. 

➡️ If you only want to remove a certain quantity, click on the “Edit” button and modify the "Quantity" field.

You can also cancel or edit the quantity of **several products at the same time**.  To do so, click on the “Cancel products” button, at the top of the page and select the products, or the quantity you want to delete. This button is only available if merchandise returns are enabled in the Customer Service menu and if the order is not already paid for.

#### 2.1.4 Register a new payment for an order.

To register a new payment, go to the Payments section of the order page.

- Select the date of the payment and the payment method used
- Enter the transaction ID
- Enter the amount and select the currency 
- Select the invoice on which you want this payment to appear
- Click on the "Add" button to save 

![img](https://docs.prestashop-project.org/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F3898701297-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-legacy-files%2Fo%2Fassets%252F-MCHq1J-FbQwQZ2OB1vQ%252F-MUDJXKnoxq__EXwKDgT%252F-MUDUepu0F0y1znTzwY9%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D7c968985-773d-4d0d-b97b-03050e6a09c4&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=941d700c&sv=2)

#### 2.1.5 Add a discount to an order.

‌In the Products section, at the bottom of the order product list, click on the "Add a new discount" button, and fill in the form:

- **Name:** Give the discount a short name. This will be visible to the customer.
- **Type:** Choose the discount type: "percent", "amount" or "free shipping".
- **Value:** For the "percent" or "amount" types, set the value of the discount. 
- **Invoice:** Select the invoice on which you want this discount to apply. When there is more than one invoice, you can check the box to apply the discount to all the invoices.

The discount is not applied to the shipping costs unless you check free shipping.

### 2.2  Merchants can process returns and refunds.

https://docs.prestashop-project.org/v.8-documentation/user-guide/selling/managing-orders/order-page-management/creating-returns-and-refunds

## 3 Merchants can view the information of all registered customers, manage their addresses, view their order history, and create customer groups to offer exclusive discounts or services.

**All the text descriptions below are taken from this overall URL page:https://docs.prestashop-project.org/v.8-documentation/user-guide/selling/managing-customers/your-customers**

### 3.1  Merchants can view all their customers.

The first page under the "Customers" menu gives you a list of all the registered users on your shop.

![img](https://docs.prestashop-project.org/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F3898701297-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-legacy-files%2Fo%2Fassets%252Fenglish-documentation-for-prestashop-1-7%252F-MD-vfnaVcWH12Xtc2rz%252F-MD-vwbFrDRPWYLjS9Ba%252F51839856.png%3Fgeneration%3D1595596083440519%26alt%3Dmedia&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=8aa5e00c&sv=2)

This gives you a bird's eye view of your customers, with some details thrown in which you can use to sort and search accounts:

- **ID.** The unique ID attached to the customer.
- **Social title**. Customers can declare their social title, which are matched with a genre and can help you better customize your customers' experience. There are two default social titles (Mr. and Mrs.), but you can create more in the "Titles" page under the "Customers settings" page in the "Shop Parameters" menu.
- **First name and Last name**. The customer's name.
- **Email address**. The email address the customer used to register on your shop.
- **Sales**. How much the customer has spent on your shop so far.
- **Enabled**. Indicates whether the customer is active or not. You can disable an account by clicking on the green checkmark.
- **Newsletter**. Indicates whether the customer is subscribed to your shop's newsletter or not. You can unsubscribe from it by clicking on the green checkmark.
- **Partner offers**. Indicates whether the account has accepted to receive e-mails from your partners or not. You can unsubscribe it clicking on the green checkmark. **Do not subscribe a user to these e-mails without their consent, as this is considered spam**.
- Registration date and last visit can always be useful when sorting user accounts.
- **Actions**. You can edit the user's account, simply view it in full (with its messages, orders, addresses, vouchers, etc.), or trash it forever.

When installed for the first time with sample data, PrestaShop has a default user, named John DOE.

You can use this fake user to test some of your shop's features, and browse your shop and see it the way a regular user would.

To log in to your shop using this public account, use these credentials:

- E-mail address: [pub@prestashop.com](mailto:pub@prestashop.com)
- Password: 123456789

**Before you open your shop to the public, make sure to delete this default user, or at least change its credentials!** If not, malicious visitors could use it to make fake purchases and more.

Below the customers table is the "Set required fields for this section" button. It opens a form where you can indicate if a database field is necessary or not by checking the appropriate boxes: this way, you can make it so fields such "partner offers" are mandatory when a visitor is creating a customer account on your shop.

You can export a list of your clients by clicking on the "Export" button at the top. You can also import customers using the "Import" button. You will need your CSV file to follow this format:

Copy

```
ID;Title;Last name;First Name;Email address;Age;Enabled;News.;Opt.;Registration;Last visit;
2;1;Gorred;Francis;francis@example.com;-;1;0;0;2013-07-04 15:20:02;2013-07-04 15:18:50;
1;1;DOE;John;pub@prestashop.com;43;1;1;1;2013-07-02 17:36:07;2013-07-03 16:04:15;
```

More import options are available in the "Import" page of the "Advanced parameters" menu.

### 3.2 Merchants can view detailed customer information.

In the case where you would like to have more information on a given customer, you can click on the "view" button, located at the end of the row in the customer's list. A new page appears.

![img](https://docs.prestashop-project.org/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F3898701297-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-legacy-files%2Fo%2Fassets%252Fenglish-documentation-for-prestashop-1-7%252F-MD-vfnaVcWH12Xtc2rz%252F-MD-vwbG5g0vwLHP4k0l%252F51839857.png%3Fgeneration%3D1595596083895757%26alt%3Dmedia&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=55e90adf&sv=2)

The various sections provide you with some key data on the user:

- **Customer information**, first and last name, e-mail address, ID, sign-up date, date of last visit, rank.
- Information regarding the subscription to the store's newsletter and subscription to ads from partnering companies, the age, date of last update, and whether or not the account is active.
- **Private notes** from the store's employees (i.e. you or your team).
- **Messages** sent by the customer to the shop's team (through customer service).
- Available **vouchers** / cart rules.
- **Previous connections** to the shop.
- The **groups** to which the customer belongs.
- Summary of the customer's past **orders**. Amount spent, type of payment, order status. For more information about each order, click on the order's date.
- **Carts** that the customer has created (but not necessarily validated) since sign-up. When your customer is currently on your shop, you can see what is being added to the cart in real time.
- Summary of the products that were purchased by a customer. Among other things, this enables you to know when a customer is very fond of a product, and maybe create a special discount for the 10th purchase. Clicking on a product directs to the order to which that product is tied.
- A list of the **product viewed** by the customer. Likewise, you can see which product pages the customer visited on your website. If no order follows several visits of a product, maybe you can help the customer decide by sending him/her a targeted discount.
- Registered **addresses**.

### 3.3 Merchants can search for customers.

Searching for a customer on your PrestaShop shop can be done two different ways.

**The first method** consists of entering the information you have into the PrestaShop search bar, which is found in the top center of your back office. By selecting "everywhere", "by name" or "by ip address", you can perform a search based on:

- ID. The numbers that is assigned to the customer in the database.
- First or last name. Note that you cannot search for both: choose either "john" or "doe", as "john doe" won't work.
- E-mail address.
- IP address. You can search using the IP of the latest connection to your shop.

The results, if any, are then presented: the list presents you with the users' ID, social title, email, birth date, registration date, amount of orders and whether or not the user's account is active. From there on, you can view the whole user's page, or edit its details.

**The second method** consists of going to the "Customers" page, and listing all of your customers.

![img](https://docs.prestashop-project.org/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F3898701297-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-legacy-files%2Fo%2Fassets%252Fenglish-documentation-for-prestashop-1-7%252F-MD-vfnaVcWH12Xtc2rz%252F-MD-vwbIQfCGrGMkJcw4%252F51839859.png%3Fgeneration%3D1595596083308655%26alt%3Dmedia&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=d0502e6d&sv=2)

On this page, you can complete the fields at the top of the list, in order to filter it according to the following criteria: ID, social title, first name, last name, email address, age, account status (enabled or disabled), subscription to the newsletter, subscription to partnering ads, registration date, and last connection date. Enter your criteria and click the "Filter" button in the top right-hand corner of the table. You can then sort the list for some of the columns.

Click the "Reset" button to go back to the complete list.

#### Installing using the upload form

To install a new module automatically, click on the "Upload a module" button at the top of the page. A pop-up window will open.

![img](https://docs.prestashop-project.org/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F3898701297-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-legacy-files%2Fo%2Fassets%252Fenglish-documentation-for-prestashop-1-7%252F-MD-wQcGVavHD0kqThCr%252F-MD-zRz-YIFAY4rReuXc%252F51185188.png%3Fgeneration%3D1595597002447147%26alt%3Dmedia&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=ec5d9b83&sv=2)

This block enables you to upload the archive file of the module, as downloaded. You can either upload a `zip` file, or a `tar.gz` one (tarball). Simply drop the module's file here, or browse to the file that you downloaded by clicking on "select file". Do not point to the module's uncompressed folder or any of its unpacked files: only the archive file! 

Once the file is detected, the installation will start automatically: the software will upload the module from your computer to its server, unpack it, place the files in the correct location, and update the page, all this in a handful of seconds. The software will then display a "Module installed!" message.

Modules are not installed by default: you still have to click the module's "Install" button, and then possibly configure its settings via the "Installed modules" tab.

Once the configuration is complete, be sure to test the module immediately to confirm that it works as planned.

#### Installing using an FTP client

You can also choose to install a module by yourself, using an FTP client.

To install a new module manually:

1. Unzip (decompress) the module archive file (`.zip` or `tar.gz`). This should result in a new folder.
2. Using your FTP client, connect to the PrestaShop web server, and place the unpacked module folder in your installation's `/modules` folder. Pay attention NOT to upload that folder in another module's folder (which can happen when drag-and-dropping items). **Upload both the folder and the files it contains, not just the files.**
3. Go to your back office, in the "Selection" tab.
4. Locate the new module in the modules list. You might have to scroll down; you can also use the list's search engine, which should give you a dynamically updated list of matching module names.
5. In the row for the new module, click the "Install" button.
6. Your module is now installed and should be activated too. If necessary, click on the module's "Configure" link. Also, pay attention to any warning message that might be displayed on your screen.

Once the configuration is complete, be sure to test the module immediately to confirm that it works as planned.

Modules can come from many sources, and not all of them are reliable. This is why PrestaShop software sometimes displays a warning window for "Untrusted" modules – that is, modules that have not been verified by PrestaShop. This screen window lets you choose whether to proceed with the installation with no further notification or to stop the installation process.
